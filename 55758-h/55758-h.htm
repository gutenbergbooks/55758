<p>Transcriber's Note</p>

<p>Apparent typographical errors have been corrected. The inconsistent use
of hyphens has been retained, as has the use of both "king" and "King".
A phrase in black letter font has been bolded.</p>

<p>An advertisement for another work by the same author has been shifted to
the back of the book.</p>

<p>The illustration titled "ALPHABET" does not identify which alphabet it
is, but it appears to illustrate Egyptian hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>The "Synchronistical Table of the Principal Events in Herodotus"
towards the end of the book extends over two pages in small font: one on
the Greeks and one on the "Barbarians". The text on the Persian Empire
is spread over several columns on the second page. In this version the
table on each page has been split into two, and the text on the Persian
Empire placed at the end.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Imagine</span> yourself in the city of Athens near the close of the
year 446 <small>B.C.</small> The proud city, after many years of supremacy over
the whole of Central Greece, has passed her zenith, and is surely
on the decline. She has never recovered from the blow received
at Coronea. The year has been one of gloom and foreboding.
The coming spring will bring the end of the five years' truce; and
an invasion from the Peloponnesus is imminent. But, as the centre
of learning, refinement, and the arts, the lustre of her fame is yet
undimmed, and men of education throughout the world deem their
lives incomplete until they have sought and reached this intellectual
Mecca. During this year a stranger from Halicarnassus, in
Asia Minor, after many years of travel in Asia, Scythia, Libya,
Egypt, and Magna Græcia, has taken up his abode at Athens. He
is still a young man, hardly thirty-seven, yet his fame is that of the
first and greatest of historians. Dramatists and poets immortal
there have been, but never man has written such exquisite prose.
Twenty centuries and more shall wear away, and his history will
be read in a hundred different tongues, as well as in the beautiful
and simple Greek that he wrote. His name will grow into a
household word; the school-boy will revel in his delightful tales,
and wise men will call him the Father of History! For weeks the
people of Athens have listened entranced to the public reading of
his great work, and now the Assembly has passed a decree tendering
to him the city's thanks, together with a most substantial gift in
recognition of his talents&mdash;a purse of money equal to twelve
thousand American dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">{iv}</a></span>
Such is the account which Eusebius gives, and others to whom
we may fairly accord belief; and it adds no slight tinge of romance
to the picture to discover among the listening throng the figure of
the boy Thucydides, moved to tears by the recital, who then and
there received the impulse that made of him also a great student
and writer of history. Herodotus, noticing how intensely his
reading had affected the youth, turned to Olorus, the father of
Thucydides, who was standing near, and said: "Olorus, thy son's
soul yearns after knowledge."</p>

<p>Herodotus was born at Halicarnassus, 484 <small>B.C.</small>, and died
at Thurium in Italy, about the year 425. As in the case of
Plutarch, our knowledge of his personal history is very meagre,
aside from the little we glean from his own writings. His parents,
Lyxes and Rhœo, appear to have been of high rank and consideration
in Halicarnassus, and possessed of ample means; and his
acquaintance both at home and in Athens was of the best. A
lover of poetry and a poet by nature, the whole plan of his work,
the tone and character of his thoughts, and a multitude of words
and expressions, show him to have been perfectly familiar with the
Homeric writings. There is scarcely an author previous to his time
with whose works he does not appear to have been thoroughly
acquainted. Hecatæus, to be sure, was almost the only writer of
prose who had attained any distinction, for prose composition was
practically in its infancy; but from him and from several others, too
obscure even to be named, he freely quotes, while the poets,
Hesiod, Olen, Musæus, Archilochus, the authors of the "Cypria" and
the "Epigoni," Alcæus, Sappho, Solon, Æsop, Aristeas, Simonides
of Ceos, Phrynichus, Æschylus, and Pindar, are referred to, or
quoted, in such a way as to show an intimate acquaintance with
their works.</p>

<p>The design of Herodotus was to record the struggles between
the Greeks and barbarians, but, in carrying it out, as Wheeler, the
English analyst of the writings of Herodotus, has happily expressed
it, he is perpetually led to trace the causes of the great events of
his history; to recount the origin of that mighty contest between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">{v}</a></span>
liberty and despotism which marked the whole period; to describe
the wondrous manners and mysterious religions of nations, and the
marvellous geography and fabulous productions of the various
countries, as each appeared on the great arena; to tell to an inquisitive
and credulous people of cities vast as provinces and
splendid as empires; of stupendous walls, temples and pyramids;
of dreams, omens, and warnings from the dead; of obscure traditions
and their exact accomplishment;&mdash;and thus to prepare
their minds for the most wonderful story in the annals of men,
when all Asia united in one endless array to crush the states of
Greece; when armies bridged the seas and navies sailed through
mountains; when proud, stubborn-hearted men arose amid anxiety,
terror, confusion, and despair, and staked their lives and homes
against the overwhelming power of a foreign despot, till Heaven
itself sympathized with their struggles, and the winds and waves
delivered their country, and opened the way to victory and revenge.</p>

<p>The personal character of Herodotus, reflected from every page
that he wrote, renders his vivid story all the more happily suited
to the reading and study of boys and girls. He is as honest as
the sun; equally impartial to friends and foes; candid in the statement
of both sides of a question; and an artist withal in the gift
of delineating a character or a people with a few rapid strokes, so
bold and masterly that the sketch is placed before you with stereoscopic
distinctness. For so early a writer he presents a surprising
unity of plan, combined with a variety of detail that is amazing.
What if he does crowd and enrich his story with a world of anecdote?
What if he feels bound always to paint for you the customs,
manners, dress, and peculiarities of a people before he begins their
history? This very biographical style is the charm of his pen.
Like the flowers of the magnolia-tree, his bright stories and vivid
descriptions at times almost overwhelm the root and branch of his
narrative; yet, after all, we remember the magnolia more because
of its cloud of snowy bloom in the few fleeting days of May than
for all its green and shade in the other months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
Herodotus, to be sure, lacks that far-seeing faculty of discerning
accurately the real causes of great movements, wars, and migrations
of men&mdash;a faculty possessed pre-eminently by Thucydides
and largely by Xenophon, but he is equally far removed from the
coldness of the one and the ostentatious display of the other. He
is above all things natural, simple, and direct. "He writes," says
Aristotle, "sentences which have a continuous flow, and which end
only when the sense is complete."</p>

<p>I have allowed Herodotus, as I did Plutarch, to tell you his
story in his own words, as closely as the English idiom can reproduce
the spirit and flow of the Greek, calling gratefully to my aid
the labors of such students, analysts, and translators of Herodotus
as Rawlinson, Dahlmann, Cary, and Wheeler; and I have discarded
from the text only what is indelicate to the modern ear, or
what the young reader might find tedious, redundant, or irrelevant
to the main story. But so small a part comes under this head,
that I am sure I can fairly say to you: "This is Herodotus himself."
If you read him through and do not like him, who will be
the disappointed one? Not you, but I!</p>

<h2><i>BOOK I. CLIO.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>ORIGIN OF THE WAR BETWEEN THE GREEKS AND BARBARIANS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a publication of the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus,
made in order that the actions of men may not be effaced
by time, and that the great and wondrous deeds displayed both by
Greeks and barbarians<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
may not be deprived of renown; and,
furthermore, that the cause for which they waged war upon each
other may be known.</p>

<p>The learned among the Persians assert that the Phœnicians
were the original authors of the quarrel; that they migrated from
that which is called the Red Sea to the Mediterranean and, having
settled in the country which they now inhabit, forthwith applied
themselves to distant voyages; and that they exported Egyptian
and Assyrian merchandise, touching at other places, and also at
Argos. Argos, at that period, surpassed in every respect all those
states which are now comprehended under the general appellation
of Greece. They say, that on their arrival at Argos, the Phœnicians
exposed their merchandise for sale, and that on the fifth or sixth
day after their arrival, when they had almost disposed of their cargo,
a great number of women came down to the sea-shore, and among
them Io the daughter of the king Inachus. While these women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
were standing near the stern of the vessel, and were bargaining
for such things as most pleased them, the Phœnicians made an
attack upon them. Most of the women escaped, but Io with some
others was seized. Then the traders hurried on board and set
sail for Egypt. Thus the Persians say that Io went to Egypt, and
that this was the beginning of wrongs. After this certain Greeks
(for they are unable to tell their name), having touched at
Tyre in Phœnicia, carried off the king's daughter Europa. These
must have been Cretans. Thus far they say that they had only
returned like for like, but that after this the Greeks were guilty of
the second provocation; for having sailed down in a vessel of war
to Æa, a city of Colchis on the river Phasis, when they had accomplished
the more immediate object of their expedition, they carried
off the king's daughter Medea; and the king of Colchis, having
despatched a herald to Greece, demanded satisfaction and the
restitution of the princess; but the Greeks replied, that as they of
Asia had not given satisfaction for the stealing of Io, they would
not give any to them. In the second generation after this, Alexander,
the son of Priam, having heard of these events, was desirous
of obtaining a wife from Greece by means of violence, being fully
persuaded that he should not have to give satisfaction, since the
Greeks had not done so. When, therefore, he had carried off
Helen, the Greeks immediately sent messengers to demand her
back again and require satisfaction; but when they brought forward
these demands they were met with this reply: "You who
have not yourselves given satisfaction, nor made it when demanded,
now wish others to give it to you." After this the Greeks were
greatly to blame, for they levied war against Asia before the
Asiatics did upon Europe. Now, to carry off women by violence
the Persians think is the act of wicked men; to trouble one's self
about avenging them when so carried off is the act of foolish ones;
and to pay no regard to them when carried off, of wise men: for
it is clear, that if they had not been willing, they could not have
been carried off. Accordingly the Persians say, that they of Asia
made no account of women that were carried off; but that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
Greeks for the sake of a Lacedæmonian woman assembled a
mighty fleet, sailed to Asia, and overthrew the empire of Priam.
From this event they had always considered the Greeks as their
enemies: for the Persians claim Asia, and the barbarous nations
that inhabit it, as their own, and consider Europe and the people
of Greece as totally distinct.</p>

<p>Such is the Persian account; and to the capture of Troy they
ascribe the commencement of their enmity to the Greeks. As relates
to Io, the Phœnicians do not agree with this account of the
Persians but affirm that she voluntarily sailed away with the
traders. I, however, am not going to inquire further as to facts;
but having pointed out the person whom I myself know to have
been the first guilty of injustice toward the Greeks, I will then proceed
with my history, touching as well on the small as the great
estates of men: for of those that were formerly powerful many
have become weak, and some that were formerly weak became
powerful in my time. Knowing, therefore, the precarious nature of
human prosperity, I shall commemorate both alike.</p>

<p>Crœsus was a Lydian by birth, son of Alyattes, and sovereign
of the nations on this side the river Halys. This river flowing from
the south between the Syrians<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
and Paphlagonians, empties itself
northward into the Euxine Sea. This Crœsus was the first of the
barbarians whom we know of that subjected some of the Greeks
to the payment of tribute, and formed alliances with others. He
subdued the Ionians and Æolians, and those of the Dorians who
had settled in Asia, and formed an alliance with the Lacedæmonians;
but before his reign all the Greeks were free.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>HISTORY OF LYDIA.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> government, which formerly belonged to the Heraclidæ,
passed to the family of Crœsus, who were called Mermnadæ.
Candaules, whom the Greeks call Myrsilus, was tyrant of Sardis,
and a descendant of Alcæus, son of Hercules. For Agron, son of
Ninus, grandson of Belus, great-grandson of Alcæus, was the first
of the Heraclidæ who became king of Sardis; and Candaules, son
of Myrsus, was the last. They who ruled over this country before
Agron, were descendants of Lydus, son of Atys, from whom this
whole people, anciently called Mæonians, derived the name of
Lydians. The Heraclidæ, descended from a female slave of Jardanus
and Hercules, having been intrusted with the government by these
princes, retained the supreme power in obedience to the declaration
of an oracle: they reigned for twenty-two generations, a space
of five hundred and five years, the son succeeding to the father to
the time of Candaules, son of Myrsus. Candaules was murdered
by his favorite, Gyges, who thus obtained the kingdom,
and was confirmed in it by the oracle at Delphi. For
when the Lydians resented the murder of Candaules, and were
up in arms, the partisans of Gyges and the other Lydians came to
the following agreement, that if the oracle should pronounce him
king of the Lydians, he should reign; if not, he should restore the
power to the Heraclidæ. The oracle answered that Gyges should
become king. But the Pythian added this, "that the Heraclidæ
should be avenged on the fifth descendant of Gyges." Of this prediction
neither the Lydians nor their kings took any notice until it
was actually accomplished.</p>

<p>Thus the Mermnadæ deprived the Heraclidæ of the supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
power. Gyges sent many offerings to Delphi; indeed most of the
silver offerings at Delphi are his; and besides the silver, he gave
a vast quantity of gold; among the rest six bowls of gold, which
now stand in the treasury of the Corinthians, and are thirty
talents in weight; though, to tell the truth, this treasury does not
belong to the people of Corinth, but Cypselus son of Eetion.
Gyges was the first of the barbarians of whom we know who made
offerings at Delphi, except Midas, son of Gordius, the king of
Phrygia, who dedicated the royal throne, on which he used to sit
and administer justice, a piece of workmanship deserving of admiration.
The throne stands in the same place as the bowls of
Gyges.</p>

<p>Periander the son of Cypselus was king of Corinth, and the
Corinthians say (and the Lesbians confirm their account) that a
wonderful prodigy occurred in his life-time. Arion of Methymna,
second to none of his time in accompanying the harp, and the first
who composed, named, and represented the dithyrambus at
Corinth, was carried to Tænarus on the back of a dolphin.
Arion, having continued a long time with Periander, made a voyage
to Italy and Sicily, acquired great wealth there, and determined
to return to Corinth. He set out from Tarentum, and hired
a ship of some Corinthians, because he put more confidence in
them than in any other nation; but these men, when they were in
the open sea, conspired together to throw him overboard and seize
his money. Learning of this he offered them his money, and
entreated them to spare his life. But he could not prevail on
them; the sailors ordered him either to kill himself, that he might
be buried ashore, or to leap immediately into the sea. Arion,
reduced to this strait, entreated them, since such was their determination,
to permit him to stand on the stern of the vessel in his full
dress and sing, and he promised when he had sung to make way
with himself. The seamen, pleased that they should hear the
best singer in the world, retired from the stern to the middle of
the vessel. Arion put on all his robes, took his harp in his hands,
stood on the rowing benches and went through the Orthian strain;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
the strain ended, he leaped into the sea as he was, in full dress;
the sailors continuing their voyage to Corinth: but a dolphin
caught him upon his back, and carried him to Tænarus; so that,
having landed, he proceeded to Corinth in his full dress, and upon
his arrival there, related all that happened. Periander gave no
credit to his relation, put Arion under close confinement, and
watched anxiously for the arrival of the seamen. When they
appeared, he summoned them and inquired if they could give any
account of Arion. They answered that he was safe in Italy,
and that they had left him flourishing at Tarentum. At that
instant Arion appeared before them just as he was when he leaped
into the sea; at which they were so astonished that, being fully
convicted, they could no longer deny the fact. These things are
reported by the Corinthians and Lesbians; and there is a little
bronze statue of Arion at Tænarus, representing a man sitting on
a dolphin.</p>

<p>Alyattes the Lydian and father of Crœsus, having waged a long
war against the Milesians, died after a reign of fifty-seven years.
Once upon recovery from an illness he dedicated at Delphi a large
silver bowl, with a saucer of iron inlaid; an object that deserves
attention above all the offerings at Delphi. It was made by
Glaucus the Chian, who first invented the art of inlaying iron.</p>

<p>At the death of Alyattes, Crœsus, then thirty-five years of age,
succeeded to the kingdom. He attacked the Ephesians before
any other Greek people. The Ephesians being besieged by him,
consecrated their city to Diana, by fastening a rope from the
temple to the wall. The distance between the old town, which
was then besieged, and the temple, is seven stadia. Crœsus afterward
attacked the several cities of the Ionians and Æolians in
succession, alleging different pretences against the various states.
After he had reduced the Greeks in Asia to the payment of tribute,
he formed a design to build ships and attack the Islanders. But
when all things were ready for the building of ships, Bias of Priene
(or, as others say, Pittacus of Mitylene) arriving at Sardis, put a
stop to his ship-building by making this reply, when Crœsus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
inquired if he had any news from Greece: "O king, the Islanders
are enlisting a large body of cavalry, with the intention of making
war upon you and Sardis." Crœsus, thinking he had spoken the
truth, said: "May the gods put such a thought into the Islanders,
as to attack the sons of the Lydians with horse." The other
answering said: "Sire, you appear to wish above all things to
see the Islanders on horseback upon the continent; and not without
reason. But what can you imagine the Islanders more earnestly
desire, after having heard of your resolution to build a fleet
to attack them, than to catch the Lydians at sea, that they may
revenge on you the cause of those Greeks who dwell on the continent,
whom you hold in subjection?" Crœsus, much pleased with
the conclusion, and convinced, (for he appeared to speak to the
purpose,) put a stop to the ship-building, and made an alliance with
the Ionians that inhabit the islands.</p>

<p>In course of time, when nearly all the nations that dwell within
the river Halys, except the Cilicians and Lycians, were subdued,
and Crœsus had added them to the Lydians, all the wise men of
that time, as each had opportunity, came from Greece to Sardis,
which had then attained to the highest degree of prosperity; and
amongst them Solon, an Athenian, who made laws for the Athenians
at their request, and absented himself for ten years, sailing
away under pretence of seeing the world, that he might not be
compelled to abrogate any of the laws he had established: for
the Athenians could not do it themselves, since they were bound
by solemn oaths to observe for ten years whatever laws Solon
should enact for them. On his arrival Solon was hospitably entertained
by Crœsus, and on the third or fourth day, by order of the
king, the attendants conducted him round the treasury, and
showed him all their grand and costly contents. After he had seen
and examined every thing sufficiently, Crœsus asked him this question:
"My Athenian guest, the great fame as well of your wisdom
as of your travels has reached even to us; I am therefore desirous
of asking you who is the most happy man you have seen?" He
asked this question because he thought himself the most happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
of men. But Solon, speaking the truth freely, without any flattery,
answered, "Tellus, the Athenian." Crœsus, astonished at his answer,
eagerly asked him: "On what account do you deem Tellus
the happiest?" He replied: "Tellus, in the first place, lived in a
well-governed commonwealth; had sons who were virtuous and
good; and he saw children born to them all, and all surviving. In
the next place, when he had lived as happily as the condition of human
affairs will permit, he ended his life in a most glorious manner.
For coming to the assistance of the Athenians in a battle
with their neighbors of Eleusis, he put the enemy to flight and
died nobly. The Athenians buried him at the public charge in the
place where he fell, and honored him greatly."</p>

<p>When Solon had roused the attention of Crœsus by relating
many happy circumstances concerning Tellus, Crœsus, expecting
at least to obtain the second place, asked, whom he had seen next
to him. "Cleobis," said he, "and Biton, natives of Argos, for they
possessed a sufficient fortune, and had withal such strength of body,
that they were both alike victorious in the public games; and
moreover the following story is related of them:&mdash;When the Argives
were celebrating a festival of Juno, it was necessary that their
mother should be drawn to the temple in a chariot; but the oxen
did not come from the field in time, the young men therefore put
themselves beneath the yoke, and drew the car in which their
mother sat; and having conveyed it forty-five stades, they reached
the temple. After they had done this in sight of the assembled
people, a most happy termination was put to their lives; and in
them the Deity clearly showed that it is better for a man to die
than to live. For the men of Argos, who stood round, commended
the strength of the youths, and the women blessed her as the
mother of such sons; but the mother herself, transported with joy
both on account of the action and its renown, stood before the
image and prayed that the goddess would grant to Cleobis and
Biton, her own sons, who had so highly honored her, the greatest
blessing man could receive. After this prayer, when they had
sacrificed and partaken of the feast, the youths fell asleep in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
temple itself, and never woke more, but met with such a termination
of life. Upon this the Argives, in commemoration of their
filial affection, caused their statues to be made and dedicated at
Delphi."</p>

<p>Thus Solon adjudged the second place of felicity to these
youths. Then Crœsus was enraged, and said: "My Athenian
friend, is my happiness then so slighted by you as worth nothing,
that you do not think me of so much value as private men?" He
answered: "Crœsus, do you inquire of me concerning human affairs&mdash;of
me, who know that the divinity is always jealous, and delights
in confusion. For in lapse of time men are constrained to
see many things they would not willingly see, and to suffer
many things they would not willingly suffer. Now I put the
term of man's life at seventy years; these seventy years then give
twenty-five thousand two hundred days, without including the intercalary
months of the leap years, and if we add that month
to every other year, in order that the seasons arriving at the
proper time may agree, the intercalary months will be thirty-five
more in the seventy years, and the days of these months will be
one thousand and fifty. Yet in all this number of twenty-six
thousand two hundred and fifty days, that compose these seventy
years, one day produces nothing exactly the same as another.
Thus, then, O Crœsus, man is altogether the sport of fortune. You
appear to me to be master of immense treasures, and king of many
nations; but as relates to what you inquire of me, I cannot say,
till I hear that you have ended your life happily. For the richest
of men is not more happy than he that has a sufficiency for a day,
unless good fortune attend him to the grave, so that he ends his
life in happiness. Many men who abound in wealth are unhappy;
and many who have only a moderate competency are fortunate.
He that abounds in wealth, and is yet unhappy, surpasses the other
only in two things; but the other surpasses the wealthy and the
miserable in many things. The former indeed is better able to
gratify desire and to bear the blow of adversity. But the latter
surpasses him in this; he is not indeed equally able to bear misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
or satisfy desire, but his good fortune wards off these things
from him; and he enjoys the full use of his limbs, he is free from
disease and misfortune, he is blessed with good children and a fine
form, and if, in addition to all these things, he shall end his life
well, he is the man you seek and may justly be called happy; but
before he die we ought to suspend our judgment, and not pronounce
him happy, but fortunate."</p>

<p>When Solon had spoken thus to Crœsus, Crœsus did not confer
any favor on him, but holding him in no account, dismissed him
as a very ignorant man, because he overlooked present prosperity,
and bade men look to the end of every thing.</p>

<p>After the departure of Solon, the indignation of the gods fell
heavily upon Crœsus, probably because he thought himself the
most happy of all men. A dream soon after visited him while
sleeping, which pointed out to him the truth of the misfortunes that
were about to befall him in the person of one of his sons. For
Crœsus had two sons, of whom one was grievously afflicted, for he
was dumb; but the other, whose name was Atys, far surpassed all
the young men of his age. Now the dream intimated to Crœsus
that he would lose this Atys by a wound inflicted with the point of
an iron weapon. When he awoke, and had considered the matter
with himself, he relieved Atys from the command of the Lydian
troops, and never after sent him out on that business; and causing
all spears, lances, and such other weapons as men use in war, to be
removed from the men's apartments, he had them laid up in private
chambers, that none of them being suspended might fall upon his
son. While Crœsus was engaged with the nuptials of his son, a
man oppressed by misfortune, and whose hands were polluted, a
Phrygian by birth, and of royal family, arrived at Sardis. This
man, having come to the palace of Crœsus, sought permission to
obtain purification according to the custom of the country. Crœsus
purified him, performing the usual ceremony, and then inquired:
"Stranger, who art thou, and from what part of Phrygia hast thou
come as a suppliant to my hearth? and what man or woman hast
thou slain?" The stranger answered: "I am the son of Gordius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
and grandson of Midas, and am called Adrastus. I unwittingly
slew my own brother, and being banished by my father and
deprived of every thing, I have come hither." Then said Crœsus:
"You were born of parents who are our friends, and you have
come to friends, among whom, if you will stay, you shall want
nothing; and by bearing your misfortune as lightly as possible you
will be the greatest gainer." So Adrastus took up his abode in
the palace of Crœsus.</p>

<p>At this time a boar of enormous size appeared in Mysian
Olympus, and rushing down from that mountain, ravaged the fields
of the Mysians. The Mysians, though they often went out against
him, could not hurt him, but suffered much from him. At last
deputies from the Mysians came to Crœsus and said: "O king,
a boar of enormous size has appeared in our country, and ravages
our fields: though we have often endeavored to take him, we cannot.
We therefore earnestly beg, that you will send with us your
son and some chosen youths with dogs, that we may drive him
from the country." But Crœsus, remembering the warning of his
dream, answered: "Make no further mention of my son; I shall
not send him with you, because he is lately married, but I will give
you chosen Lydians, and the whole hunting train, and will order
them to assist you with their best endeavors in driving the monster
from your country." The Mysians were content with this, but
Atys, who had heard of their request, came in, and earnestly protested:
"Father, you used to permit me to signalize myself in
the two most noble and becoming exercises of war and hunting;
but now you keep me excluded from both, without having observed
in me either cowardice or want of spirit. How will men look on
me when I go or return from the forum? What kind of a man
shall I appear to my fellow-citizens? What to my newly married
wife? Either let me then go to this hunt, or convince me that
it is better for me to do as you would have me." "My son," said
Crœsus, "I act thus, not because I have seen any cowardice, or
any thing else unbecoming in you; but a vision in a dream warned
me that you would be short-lived, and would die by the point of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
an iron weapon. It was on account of this that I hastened your
marriage, and now refuse to send you on this expedition; taking
care to preserve you, if by any means I can, as long as I live; for
you are my only son; the other, who is deprived of his hearing,
I consider as lost." The youth answered: "You are not to blame,
my father, if after such a dream you take so much care of me; but
you say the dream signified that I should die by the point of an
iron weapon. What hand, or what pointed iron weapon has a
boar, to occasion such fears in you? Had it said I should lose my
life by a tusk, you might do as you have, but it said by the point
of a weapon; then since we have not to contend against men, let
me go." "You have outdone me," replied Crœsus, "in explaining
the import of the dream, you shall go to the chase."</p>

<p>Then turning to the Phrygian Adrastus, he exclaimed: "Adrastus,
I beg you to be my son's guardian, when he goes to the chase,
and take care that no skulking villains show themselves in the way to
do him harm. Besides, you ought to go for your own sake, where you
may signalize yourself by your exploits; this was the glory of your
ancestors, and you are besides in full vigor." Adrastus answered:
"On no other account, my lord, would I take part in this enterprise;
it is not fitting that one in my unfortunate circumstances
should join with his prosperous compeers. But since you urge me,
I ought to oblige you. Rest assured, that your son, whom you bid
me take care of, shall, as far as his guardian is concerned, return
to you uninjured."</p>

<p>Then all went away, well provided with chosen youths and dogs,
and, having arrived at Mount Olympus, they sought the wild beast,
found him and encircled him around. Among the rest, the stranger,
Adrastus, throwing his javelin at the boar, missed him, and struck
the son of Crœsus; thus fulfilling the warning of the dream. Upon
this, some one ran off to tell Crœsus what had happened, and having
arrived at Sardis, gave him an account of the action, and of
his son's fate. Crœsus, exceedingly distressed by the death of his
son, lamented it the more bitterly, because he fell by the hand of
one, whom he himself had purified from blood; and vehemently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
deploring his misfortune, he invoked Jove the Expiator, attesting
what he had suffered by this stranger. He invoked also the same
deity, by the name of the god of hospitality and private friendship:
as the god of hospitality, because by receiving a stranger into his
house, he had unawares fostered the murderer of his son; as the
god of private friendship, because, having sent him as a guardian,
he found him his greatest enemy. Soon the Lydians approached,
bearing the corpse, and behind it followed the murderer. He,
having advanced in front of the body, delivered himself up to
Crœsus, stretching out his hands and begging him to kill him upon
it; for he ought to live no longer. When Crœsus heard this,
though his own affliction was so great, he pitied Adrastus, and
said to him: "You have made me full satisfaction by condemning
yourself to die. You are not the author of this misfortune, except
as far as you were the involuntary agent; but that god, whoever
he was, that long since foreshowed what was about to happen."
Crœsus buried his son as the dignity of his birth required; but the
son of Gordius, when all was silent around, judging himself the
most heavily afflicted of all men, killed himself on the tomb.</p>

<p>Some time after, the overthrow of the kingdom of Astyages,
son of Cyaxares, by Cyrus, son of Cambyses, and the growing
power of the Persians, put an end to the grief of Crœsus; and it
entered into his thoughts whether he could by any means check
the growing power of the Persians before they became formidable.
After he had formed this purpose, he determined to make trial as
well of the oracles in Greece as of that in Lydia; and sent different
persons to different places, some to Delphi, some to Abæ of Phocis,
and some to Dodona.</p>

    <p>OFFERING AT THE TEMPLE OF DELPHI.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He endeavored to propitiate the god at Delphi by magnificent
sacrifices; for he offered three thousand head of cattle of every
kind fit for sacrifice, and having heaped up a great pile, he burned
on it beds of gold and silver, vials of gold, and robes of purple and
garments; hoping by that means more completely to conciliate
the god. When the sacrifice was ended, having melted down a
vast quantity of gold, he cast half-bricks from it; of which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
longest were six palms in length, the shortest three, and in thickness
one palm: their number was one hundred and seventeen:
four of these, of pure gold, weighed each two talents and a half;
the other half-bricks of pale gold, weighed two talents each. He
made also the figure of a lion of fine gold, weighing ten talents.
This lion, when the temple of Delphi was burned down, fell from
the half-bricks, for it had been placed on them; and it now lies in
the treasury of the Corinthians, weighing six talents and a half;
for three talents and a half were melted from it. Crœsus, having
finished these things sent them to Delphi, and with them these following:
two large bowls, one of gold, the other of silver; that of
gold was placed on the right hand as you enter the temple, and
that of silver on the left; but these also were removed when the
temple was burnt down; and the golden one weighing eight
talents and a half and twelve minæ, is placed in the treasury of
Clazomenæ; the silver one, containing six hundred amphoræ, lies
in a corner of the vestibule, and is used by the Delphians for mixing
the wine on the Theophanian festival. The Delphians say it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
was the workmanship of Theodorus the Samian; and I think so
too, for it appears to be no common work. He also sent four
casks of silver, which stand in the treasury of the Corinthians; and
he dedicated two lustral vases, one of gold, the other of silver: on
the golden one is an inscription, OF THE LACEDÆMONIANS,
who say that it was their offering, but wrongfully, for it was given
by Crœsus: a certain Delphian made the inscription, in order to
please the Lacedæmonians; I know his name, but forbear to
mention it. The boy, indeed, through whose hand the water flows,
is their gift; but neither of the lustral vases. At the same time
Crœsus sent many other offerings without an inscription: amongst
them some round silver covers; and a statue of a woman in gold
three cubits high, which the Delphians say is the image of
Crœsus's baking woman; and to all these things he added the
necklaces and girdles of his wife.</p>

<p>These were the offerings he sent to Delphi; and to Amphiaraus,
having ascertained his virtue and sufferings, he dedicated a shield
all of gold, and a lance of solid gold, the shaft as well as the points
being of gold. These are now at Thebes in the temple of Ismenian
Apollo.</p>

<p>To the Lydians appointed to convey these presents to the
temples, Crœsus gave it in charge to inquire of the oracles, whether
he should make war on the Persians, and if he should invite any
other nation as an ally. Accordingly, when the Lydians arrived at
the places to which they were sent, and had dedicated the offerings,
they consulted the oracles, saying: "Crœsus, king of the
Lydians and of other Nations, esteeming these to be the only
oracles among men, sends these presents in acknowledgment of
your discoveries; and now asks whether he should lead an army
against the Persians, and whether he should join any auxiliary
forces with his own?" Such were their questions; and the
opinions of both oracles concurred, foretelling: "That if Crœsus
should make war on the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire;"
and they advised him to engage the most powerful of the
Greeks in his alliance. When Crœsus heard the answers that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
were brought back, he was beyond measure delighted with the
oracles; and fully expecting that he should destroy the kingdom
of Cyrus, he again sent to Delphi, and having ascertained the
number of the inhabitants, presented each of them with two staters
of gold. In return for this, the Delphians gave Crœsus and the
Lydians the right to consult the oracle before any others, and exemption
from tribute, and the first seats in the temple, and the
privilege of being made citizens of Delphi, to as many as should
desire it in all future time. Crœsus, having made these presents
to the Delphians, sent a third time to consult the oracle. For
after he had ascertained the veracity of the oracle, he had frequent
recourse to it. His demand now was whether he should long enjoy
the kingdom? to which the Pythian gave this answer: "When
a mule shall become king of the Medes, then, tender-footed Lydian,
flee over pebbly Hermus, nor tarry, nor blush to be a coward."
With this answer, when reported to him, Crœsus was more than
ever delighted, thinking that a mule should never be king of the
Medes instead of a man, and consequently that neither he nor his
posterity should ever be deprived of the kingdom. In the next
place he began to enquire carefully who were the most powerful
of the Greeks whom he might gain over as allies; and on inquiry
found that the Lacedæmonians and Athenians excelled the rest,
the former being of Dorian, the latter of Ionic descent: for these
were in ancient time the most distinguished, the latter being a
Pelasgian, the other an Hellenic nation.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>ORIGIN OF ATHENS AND SPARTA.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> language the Pelasgians used I cannot with certainty
affirm; but if I may form a conjecture from those Pelasgians who
now exist, and inhabit the town of Crestona above the Tyrrhenians,
and from those Pelasgians settled at Placia and Scylace on the
Hellespont, they spoke a barbarous language. And if the whole
Pelasgian body did so, the Attic race, being Pelasgic, must at the
time they changed into Hellenes have altered their language. The
Hellenic race, however, appears to have used the same language
from the time they became a people. At first insignificant, yet
from a small beginning they have increased to a multitude of
nations, chiefly by a union with many other barbarous nations.
But the Pelasgic race, being barbarous, never increased to any
great extent.</p>

<p>Of these nations Crœsus learnt that the Attic was oppressed
and distracted by Pisistratus, then reigning in Athens. When a
quarrel happened between those who dwelt on the sea-coast and
the Athenians, the former headed by Megacles, the latter by
Lycurgus, Pisistratus aiming at the sovereign power, formed a
third party; and having assembled his partisans under color of
protecting those of the mountains, he contrived this stratagem.
He wounded himself and his mules, drove his chariot into the
public square, as if he had escaped from enemies that designed to
murder him in his way to the country, and besought the people
to grant him a guard, having before acquired renown in the expedition
against Megara, by taking its port, Nisæa, and displaying
other illustrious deeds. The people of Athens, deceived by this,
gave him such of the citizens as he selected, who were not to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
his javelin men, but club-bearers, for they attended him with clubs
of wood. These men, joining in revolt with Pisistratus seized the
Acropolis, and Pisistratus assumed the government of the Athenians,
neither disturbing the existing magistracies, nor altering the
laws; but he administered the government according to the established
institutions, liberally and well. Not long after, the partisans
of Megacles and Lycurgus became reconciled and drove him out.
In this manner Pisistratus first made himself master of Athens,
and, his power not being firmly rooted, lost it. But those who
expelled Pisistratus quarrelled anew with one another; and
Megacles, harassed by the sedition, sent a herald to Pisistratus to
ask if he was willing to marry his daughter, on condition of having
the sovereignty. Pisistratus having accepted the proposal and
agreed to his terms, in order to his restitution, they contrive the
most ridiculous project that, I think, was ever imagined; especially
if we consider, that the Greeks have from old been distinguished
from the barbarians as being more acute and free from all foolish
simplicity, and more particularly as they played this trick upon the
Athenians, who are esteemed among the wisest of the Greeks. In
the Pæanean tribe was a woman named Phya, four cubits high,
wanting three fingers, and in other respects handsome; this woman
they dressed in a complete suit of armor, placed her on a chariot,
and having shown her beforehand how to assume the most becoming
demeanor, they drove her to the city, with heralds before, who,
on their arrival in the city, proclaimed what was ordered in these
terms: "O Athenians, receive with kind wishes Pisistratus whom
Minerva herself honoring above all men now conducts back to
her own citadel." The report was presently spread among the
people that Minerva was bringing back Pisistratus; and the people
in the city believing this woman to be the goddess, both adored a
human being, and received Pisistratus.</p>

<div class="section"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></div>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>ATHENS FROM MOUNT HYMETTUS.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Pisistratus having recovered the sovereignty in the manner
above described, married the daughter of Megacles in accordance
with his agreement, but Pisistratus soon hearing of designs that
were being formed against him, withdrew entirely out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
country, and arriving in Eretria, consulted with his sons. The
opinion of Hippias prevailing, to recover the kingdom, they immediately
began to collect contributions from those cities which felt
any gratitude to them for benefits received; and though many
gave large sums, the Thebans surpassed the rest in liberality. At
length (not to give a detailed account) time passed, and every
thing was ready for their return, for Argive mercenaries arrived
from Peloponnesus; and a man of Naxos, named Lygdamis, who
had come as a volunteer, and brought both men and money,
showed great zeal in the cause. Setting out from Eretria,
they came back in the eleventh year of their exile, and first of all
possessed themselves of Marathon. While they lay encamped in
this place, their partisans from the city joined them, and others
from the various districts, to whom a tyranny was more welcome
than liberty, crowded to them. The Athenians of the city, on the
other hand, had shown very little concern all the time Pisistratus
was collecting money, or even when he took possession of Marathon.
But when they heard that he was marching from Marathon
against the city, they at length went out to resist him; and
marched with their whole force against the invaders. In the mean
time Pisistratus's party, advanced towards the city, and arrived in
a body at the temple of the Pallenian Minerva, and there took up
their position. Here Amphilytus, a prophet of Acarnania, moved
by divine impulse, approached Pisistratus, and pronounced this
oracle in hexameter verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote">The cast is thrown&mdash;the net expanded wide&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">At night the tunnies in the snare will glide."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>He, inspired by the god, uttered this prophecy; and Pisistratus,
comprehending the oracle, and saying he accepted the
omen, led on his army. The Athenians of the city were then
engaged at their breakfast, and some of them after breakfast had
betaken themselves to dice, others to sleep; so that the army of
Pisistratus, falling upon them by surprise, soon put them to flight.
As they were flying, Pisistratus contrived a clever stratagem to
prevent their rallying again, and forced them thoroughly to disperse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
He mounted his sons on horseback and sent them forward. They,
overtaking the fugitives, spoke as they were ordered by Pisistratus,
bidding them be of good cheer, and to depart every man to
his own home. The Athenians yielded a ready obedience, and
thus Pisistratus, having a third time possessed himself of Athens,
secured his power, more firmly, both by the aid of auxiliary forces,
and by revenues partly collected at home and partly drawn from
the mines along the river Strymon. He seized as hostages the
sons of the Athenians who had held out against him, and had not
immediately fled, and settled them at Naxos. He moreover purified
the island of Delos, in obedience to an oracle, and having dug
up the dead bodies, as far as the prospect from the temple reached,
he removed them to another part of Delos.</p>

<p>Crœsus was informed that such was, at that time, the condition
of the Athenians; and that the Lacedæmonians, having extricated
themselves out of great difficulties, had gained the mastery over
the Tegeans in war. They had formerly been governed by the
worst laws of all the people in Greece, both as regarded their
dealings with one another, and in holding no intercourse with
strangers. But they changed to a good government in the following
manner: Lycurgus, a man much esteemed by the Spartans,
having arrived at Delphi to consult the oracle, no sooner
entered the temple, than the Pythian spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote">"Lycurgus, thou art come to my rich fane,</div>
<div class="verse">Beloved by Zeus and all the heavenly train,</div>
<div class="verse">But whether god or man I fear to say,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet god thou must be more than mortal clay."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">Some men say that, besides this, the Pythian also communicated
to him that form of government now established among the Spartans.
But, as the Lacedæmonians themselves affirm, Lycurgus
being appointed guardian to his nephew Leobotis,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
king of Sparta, brought those institutions from Crete. For as soon as he
had taken the guardianship, he altered all their customs, and took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
care that no one should transgress them. Afterwards he established
military regulations, and instituted the ephori and senators.
Thus, having changed their laws, they established good institutions
in their stead. They erected a temple to Lycurgus after his
death, and held him in the highest reverence. As they had a
good soil and abundant population, they quickly sprang up and
flourished. And now they were no longer content to live in
peace; but proudly considering themselves superior to the Arcadians,
they sent to consult the oracle at Delphi, touching the conquest
of the whole country of the Arcadians; and the Pythian
gave them this answer: "Dost thou ask of me Arcadia? thou
askest a great deal; I cannot grant it thee. There are many
acorn-eating men in Arcadia, who will hinder thee. But I do not
grudge thee all; I will give thee Tegea to dance on with beating
of the feet, and a fair plain to measure out by the rod." When
the Lacedæmonians heard this answer reported, they laid aside
their design against all Arcadia; and relying on an equivocal
oracle, led an army against Tegea only, carrying fetters with them,
as if they would surely reduce the Tegeans to slavery. But being
defeated in an engagement, as many of them as were taken alive,
were compelled to work, wearing the fetters they had brought, and
measuring the lands of the Tegeans with a rod. Those fetters in
which they were bound, were, even in my time, preserved in
Tegea, suspended around the temple of Alean Minerva.</p>

<p>In the first war, therefore, they had constantly fought against
the Tegeans with ill success, but in the time of Crœsus, and during
the reign of Anaxandrides and Ariston at Lacedæmon, they at
length became superior in the following manner: When they had
always been worsted in battle by the Tegeans, they sent to enquire
of the oracle at Delphi, what god they should propitiate, in
order to become victorious over the Tegeans. The Pythian
answered, they should become so, when they had brought back the
bones of Orestes the son of Agamemnon. But as they were unable
to find the sepulchre of Orestes, they sent again to inquire
of the god in what spot Orestes lay interred, and the Pythian gave
this answer to the inquiries of those who came to consult her:</p>

<p class="nodent">When the Lacedæmonians heard this, they were as far off the discovery
as ever, though they searched every where, till Lichas, one
of the Spartans who are called Agathoergi, found it. These Agathoergi
consist of citizens who are discharged from serving in the
cavalry, such as are senior, five in every year. It is their duty
during the year in which they are discharged from the cavalry,
not to remain inactive, but go to different places where they are
sent by the Spartan commonwealth. Lichas, who was one of these
persons, discovered it in Tegea, both meeting with good fortune
and employing sagacity. For as the Lacedæmonians had at that
time intercourse with the Tegeans, he, coming to a smithy, looked
attentively at the iron being forged, and was struck with wonder
when he saw what was done. The smith perceiving his astonishment
desisted from his work, and said: "O Laconian stranger, you
would certainly have been astonished had you seen what I saw,
since you are so surprised at the working of iron. For as I was
endeavoring to sink a well in this enclosure, in digging, I came to
a coffin seven cubits long; and because I did not believe that men
were ever taller than they now are, I opened it and saw that the
body was equal to the coffin in length, and after I had measured
it I covered it up again." The man told him what he had seen, and
Lichas, reflecting on what was said, conjectured from the words of
the oracle, that this must be the body of Orestes, forming his conjecture
on the following reasons: seeing the smith's two bellows
he discerned in them the two winds, and in the anvil and hammer
the stroke answering to stroke, and in the iron that was being
forged the woe that lay on woe; representing it in this way, that
iron had been invented to the injury of man. He then returned
to Sparta, and gave the Lacedæmonians an account of the whole
matter; but they brought a feigned charge against him and sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
him into banishment. He, going back to Tegea, related his misfortune
to the smith, and wished to hire the enclosure from him,
but he would not let it. But in time, when he had persuaded him,
he took up his abode there; and having opened the sepulchre and
collected the bones, he carried them away with him to Sparta.
From that time, whenever they made trial of each other's strength,
the Lacedæmonians were by far superior in war; and the greater
part of Peloponnesus had been already subdued by them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>CONQUEST OF LYDIA BY CYRUS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Crœsus</span> being informed of all these things, sent ambassadors to
Sparta, with presents, and to request their alliance, having given
them orders what to say; and when they were arrived they spoke
as follows: "Crœsus, king of the Lydians and of other nations, has
sent us with this message: 'O Lacedæmonians, since the deity
has directed me by an oracle to unite myself to a Grecian friend,
therefore (for I am informed that you are pre-eminent in Greece),
I invite you in obedience to the oracle, being desirous of becoming
your friend and ally, without treachery or guile.'" But the
Lacedæmonians, who had before heard of the answer given by the
oracle to Crœsus, were gratified at the coming of the Lydians, and
exchanged pledges of friendship and alliance; and indeed certain
favors had been formerly conferred on them by Crœsus; for when
the Lacedæmonians sent to Sardis to purchase gold, wishing to
use it in erecting the statue of Apollo that now stands at Thornax
in Laconia, Crœsus gave it as a present to them. For this reason,
and because he had selected them from all the Greeks, and desired
their friendship, the Lacedæmonians accepted his offer of alliance;
and in the first place they promised to be ready at his summons;
and in the next, having made a great bronze bowl, capable of containing
three hundred amphoræ, and covered it outside to the rim
with various figures, they sent it to him, being desirous of making
Crœsus a present in return. But this bowl never reached Sardis,
for one of the two following reasons: the Lacedæmonians say, that
when the bowl, on its way to Sardis, was off Samos, the Samains
having heard of it, sailed out in long ships, and took it away by
force. On the other hand the Samains affirm, that when the Lacedæmonians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
who were conveying the bowl found they were too
late, and heard that Sardis was taken and Crœsus a prisoner, they
sold the bowl in Samos, and that some private persons, who bought
it dedicated it in the temple of Juno.</p>

<p>Crœsus, mistaking the oracle, prepared to invade Cappadocia,
hoping to overthrow Cyrus and the power of the Persians. Whilst
Crœsus was preparing for his expedition against the Persians, a
Lydian named Sandanis, who before that time was esteemed a
wise man, and on this occasion acquired a very great name in
Lydia, gave him advice in these words: "O king, you are preparing
to make war against a people who wear leather trousers,
and the rest of their garments of leather; who inhabit a barren
country, and feed not on such things as they choose, but such as
they can get. Besides they do not habitually use wine, but drink
water; nor have they figs to eat, nor any thing that is good. In
the first place, then, if you should conquer, what will you take
from them, since they have nothing? On the other hand, if you
should be conquered, consider what good things you will lose.
For when they have tasted of our good things, they will become
fond of them, nor will they be driven from them. As for me, I
thank the gods, that they have not put it into the thoughts of the
Persians to make war on the Lydians." Sandanis did not, however,
persuade Crœsus, for he proceeded to invade Cappadocia, as
well from a desire of adding it to his own dominions, as a wish to
punish Cyrus on account of Astyages. For Cyrus, son of Cambyses,
had subjugated Astyages, son of Cyaxares, who was brother-in-law
of Crœsus, and king of Medes.</p>

<p>Crœsus, alleging this against him, sent to ask the oracle, if he
should make war on the Persians; and when an ambiguous answer
came back, he, interpreting it to his own advantage, led his
army against the territory of the Persians. When he arrived at
the river Halys, Crœsus transported his forces, as I believe, by the
bridges which are now there. But the common opinion of the
Greeks is, that Thales the Milesian procured him a passage in the
following way: Whilst Crœsus was in doubt how his army should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
pass over the river, for they say that these bridges were not at that
time in existence, Thales, who was in the camp, caused the stream,
which flowed along the left of the army, to flow on the right instead.
He contrived it thus: having begun above the camp, he
dug a deep trench, in the shape of a half-moon, so that the river,
being turned into this from its old channel, might pass in the rear
of the camp pitched where it then was, and afterward, having
passed by the camp, might fall into its former course; so that as
soon as the river was divided into two streams it became fordable
in both. Some say, that the ancient channel of the river was entirely
dried up; but this I cannot assent to; for how then could
they have crossed it on their return?</p>

<p>However, Crœsus, having passed the river with his army, came
to a place called Pteria, in Cappadocia. (Now Pteria is the
strongest position of the whole of this country, and is situated over
against Sinope, a city on the Euxine Sea.) Here he encamped
and ravaged the lands of the Syrians; and took the city of the
Pterians, and enslaved the inhabitants; he also took all the adjacent
places, and expelled the inhabitants, who had given him no
cause for blame. But Cyrus, assembling his own army, and taking
with him all who inhabited the intermediate country, went to meet
Crœsus. But before he began to advance, he sent heralds to the
Ionians, to persuade them to revolt from Crœsus, which the Ionians
refused to do. When Cyrus had come up and encamped
opposite Crœsus, they made trial of each other's strength on the
plains of Pteria; but when an obstinate battle took place, and many
fell on both sides, they at last parted, on the approach of night,
neither having been victorious.</p>

<p>Crœsus laying the blame on his own army on account of the
smallness of its numbers, for his forces that engaged were far fewer
than those of Cyrus,&mdash;marched back to Sardis, designing to summon
the Egyptians according to treaty, and to require the presence
of the Lacedæmonians at a fixed time: having collected these together,
and assembled his own army, he purposed, when winter
was over, to attack the Persians in the beginning of the spring.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
With this design, when he reached Sardis, he despatched ambassadors
to his different allies, requiring them to meet at Sardis before
the end of five months; but the army that was with him, and
that had fought with the Persians, which was composed of mercenary
troops, he entirely disbanded, not imagining that Cyrus,
who had come off on such equal terms, would venture to advance
upon Sardis. While Crœsus was forming these plans the whole
suburbs were filled with serpents, and when they appeared, the
horses, forsaking their pastures, came and devoured them. When
Crœsus beheld this, he considered it to be, as it really was, a
prodigy, and sent immediately to consult the interpreters at Telmessus;
but the messengers having arrived there, and learnt from
the Telmessians what the prodigy portended, were unable to report
it to Crœsus, for before they sailed back to Sardis, Crœsus had
been taken prisoner. The Telmessians had pronounced as follows:
"that Crœsus must expect a foreign army to invade his country,
which, on its arrival, would subdue the natives, because, they said,
the serpent is a son of the earth, but the horse is an enemy and a
stranger."</p>

<p>Cyrus, as soon as Crœsus had retreated after the battle at Pteria,
having discovered that it was the intention of Crœsus to disband
his army, saw that it would be to his advantage to march with all
possible expedition on Sardis, before the forces of the Lydians
could be a second time assembled. Whereupon Crœsus, thrown
into great perplexity, seeing that matters had turned out contrary
to his expectations, drew out the Lydians to battle. At that time no
nation in Asia was more valiant and warlike than the Lydians.
Their mode of fighting was from on horseback; they were armed
with long lances, and managed their horses with admirable
address.</p>

<p>The place where they met was the plain that lies before the city
of Sardis, which is extensive and bare; the Hyllus and several other
rivers flowing through it force a passage into the greatest, called
the Hermus, which, flowing from the sacred mountain of mother
Cybele, falls into the sea near the city of Phocæa. Here Cyrus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
when he saw the Lydians drawn up in order of battle, alarmed at
the cavalry, had recourse to the following stratagem, on the suggestion
of Harpagus, a Mede. Collecting together all the camels
that followed his army with provisions and baggage, and causing
their burdens to be taken off, he mounted men upon them equipped
in cavalry accoutrements, and ordered them to go in advance of
the rest of his army against the Lydian horse; his infantry he
bade follow the camels, and placed the whole of his cavalry behind
the infantry. When all were drawn up in order, he charged them
not to spare any of the Lydians, but to kill every one they met;
but on no account to kill Crœsus, even if he should offer resistance
when taken. He drew up the camels in the front of the cavalry
for this reason: a horse is afraid of a camel, and cannot endure
either to see its form or to scent its smell; this then would render
the cavalry useless to Crœsus, by which the Lydian expected to
signalize himself. Accordingly, when they joined battle, the horses
no sooner smelt the camels and saw them, than they wheeled
round, and the hopes of Crœsus were destroyed. Nevertheless,
the Lydians were not discouraged, but leaped from their horses
and engaged with the Persians on foot; but at last, when many
had fallen on both sides, the Lydians were put to flight, and being
shut up within the walls, were besieged by the Persians.</p>

<p>Sardis was taken in the following manner. On the fourteenth
day after Crœsus had been besieged, Cyrus sent horsemen throughout
his army, and proclaimed that he would liberally reward the
man who should first mount the wall; upon this several attempts
were made, and as often failed; till, after the rest had desisted, a
Mardian, whose name was Hyrœades, endeavored to climb up on
that part of the citadel where no guard was stationed, for on that
side the citadel was precipitous and impracticable. Hyrœades had
seen a Lydian the day before come down this precipice for a helmet
that had rolled down, and carry it up again. He thereupon
ascended the same way, followed by divers Persians; and when
great numbers had gone up, Sardis was thus taken, and the whole
town plundered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
The following incidents befel Crœsus himself. He had a son of
whom I have before made mention, who was dumb. Now, in the
time of his former prosperity, Crœsus had done every thing he
could for him, and among other expedients had sent to consult the
oracle of Delphi concerning him; but the Pythian gave him this
answer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote">"O foolish king of Lydia, do not seek</div>
<div class="verse">To hear thy son within thy palace speak!</div>
<div class="verse">Better for thee that pleasure to forego&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The day he speaks will be a day of woe."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">When the city was taken, one of the Persians, not knowing
Crœsus, was about to kill him; Crœsus, though he saw him approach,
took no heed of him, caring not if he should die by the
blow; but this speechless son of his, when he saw the Persian
advancing against him, through dread and anguish, burst into
speech, and said: "Man, kill not Crœsus." These were the first
words he ever uttered; but from that time he continued to speak
during the remainder of his life. So the Persians got possession
of Sardis, and made Crœsus prisoner, after he had reigned fourteen
years, been besieged fourteen days, and lost his great empire,
as the oracle had predicted. The Persians, having taken him,
conducted him to Cyrus; and he, having heaped up a great pile,
placed Crœsus upon it, bound with fetters, and with him fourteen
young Lydians; designing either to offer this sacrifice to some
god, as the first fruits of his victory, or wishing to perform a vow;
or perhaps, having heard that Crœsus was a religious person, he
placed him on the pile for the purpose of discovering whether any
deity would save him from being burned alive. When Crœsus
stood upon the pile, notwithstanding the weight of his misfortunes,
the words of Solon recurred to him, as spoken by inspiration of
the deity, that "No living man could be justly called happy."
When this occurred to him, it is said, that after a long silence he
recovered himself, and uttering a groan, thrice pronounced the
name of Solon; when Cyrus heard him, he commanded his interpreters
to ask Crœsus whom it was he called upon; Crœsus for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
some time kept silence; but at last, being constrained to speak,
said: "I named a man, whose discourses I more desire all tyrants
might hear, than to be possessor of the greatest riches." When
he gave them this obscure answer, they again inquired what he
said, and were very importunate; he at length told them that
Solon, an Athenian, formerly visited him, and having viewed all
his treasures, made no account of them; telling, in a word, how
every thing had befallen him as Solon had warned him, though his
discourse related to all mankind as much as to himself, and especially
to those who imagine themselves happy. The pile now was
kindled, and the outer parts began to burn; when Cyrus, informed
by the interpreters of what Crœsus had said, relented, considering
that being but a man, he was yet going to burn another man alive,
who had been no way inferior to himself in prosperity; and moreover,
fearing retribution, and reflecting that nothing human is constant,
commanded the fire to be instantly extinguished, and Crœsus,
with those who were about him, to be taken down. But they with
all their endeavors were unable to master the fire. Crœsus, perceiving
that Cyrus had altered his resolution, when he saw every
man endeavoring to put out the fire, but unable to get the better
of it, shouted aloud, invoking Apollo, and besought him, if ever
any of his offerings had been agreeable to him, to protect and deliver
him from the present danger. And the Lydians relate, as he
with tears invoked the god, on a sudden clouds were seen gathering
in the air, which before was serene, and that a violent storm
burst forth and vehement rain fell and extinguished the flames;
by which Cyrus perceiving that Crœsus was beloved by the gods,
and a good man, when he had had him taken down from the pile,
asked him the following question: "Who persuaded you, Crœsus,
to invade my territories, and to become my enemy instead of my
friend?" He answered: "O king, I have done this for your good
but my own evil fortune, and the god of the Greeks who encouraged
me to make war is the cause of all. For no man is so void
of understanding as to prefer war before peace; for in the latter
children bury their fathers; in the former, fathers bury their children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
But, I suppose, it pleased the gods that these things should
be so."</p>

<p>Cyrus, having set him at liberty, placed him by his own side,
and showed him great respect. But Crœsus, absorbed in thought
remained silent; and presently turning round and beholding the
Persians sacking the city of the Lydians, he said, "Does it become
me, O king, to tell you what is passing through my mind, or to
keep silence?" Cyrus bade him say with confidence whatever
he wished; upon which Crœsus asked him, "What is this vast
crowd so earnestly employed about?" He answered, "They are
sacking your city, and plundering your riches." "Not so," Crœsus
replied, "they are neither sacking my city, nor plundering my
riches, for they are no longer mine; they are ravaging what
belongs to you." The reply of Crœsus attracted the attention of
Cyrus; he therefore ordered all the rest to withdraw, and asked
Crœsus what he thought should be done in the present conjuncture.
He answered: "Since the gods have made me your servant,
I think it my duty to acquaint you, if I perceive anything
deserving of remark. The Persians, who are by nature overbearing,
are poor. If, therefore, you permit them to plunder and
possess great riches, you may expect the following results; whoso
acquires the greatest riches, be assured, will be ready to rebel.
Therefore, if you approve what I say, adopt the following plan:
place some of your body-guard as sentinels at every gate, with
orders to take the booty from all those who would go out, and to
acquaint them that the tenth must of necessity be consecrated to
Jupiter; thus you will not incur the odium of taking away their
property; and they, acknowledging your intention to be just,
will readily obey." Cyrus was exceedingly delighted at this suggestion,
and ordered his guards to carry it out, then turning to
Crœsus, he said: "Since you are resolved to display the deeds and
words of a true king, ask whatever boon you desire on the instant."
"Sir," he answered, "the most acceptable favor you can bestow
upon me is, to let me send my fetters to the god of the Greeks,
whom I have honored more than any other deity, and to ask him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
if it be his custom to deceive those who deserve well of him."
Certain Lydians were accordingly sent to Delphi, with orders to
lay his fetters at the entrance of the temple, and to ask the god, if
he were not ashamed to have encouraged Crœsus by his oracles
to make war on the Persians assuring him that he would put an
end to the power of Cyrus, of which war such were the first-fruits
(commanding them at these words to show the fetters), and at the
same time to ask if it were the custom of the Grecian gods to be
ungrateful. When the Lydians arrived at Delphi, and had delivered
their message, the Pythian is reported to have made this
answer: "The god himself even cannot avoid the decrees of
fate; and Crœsus has atoned for the crime of Gyges his ancestor in
the fifth generation, who, being one of the body-guard of the
Heraclidæ, murdered his master, Candaules, and usurped his dignity,
to which he had no right. But although Apollo was desirous
that the fall of Sardis might happen in the time of the sons of
Crœsus, and not during his reign, yet it was not in his power to
avert the fates; but so far as they allowed he accomplished, and
conferred the boon on him; for he delayed the capture of Sardis
for the space of three years. Let Crœsus know, therefore, that he
was taken prisoner three years later than the fates had ordained;
and in the next place, he came to his relief, when he was upon the
point of being burnt alive. Then, as to the prediction of the
oracle, Crœsus has no right to complain; for Apollo foretold him
that if he made war on the Persians, he would subvert a great
empire; and had he desired to be truly informed, he ought to have
sent again to inquire, whether his own or that of Cyrus was meant.
But since he neither understood the oracle, nor inquired again, let
him lay the blame on himself. And when he last consulted the
oracle, he did not understand the answer concerning the mule;
for Cyrus was that mule; inasmuch as he was born of parents of
different nations, the mother superior, but the father inferior. For
she was a Mede, and daughter of Astyages, king of Media; but
he was a Persian, subject to the Medes." When Crœsus heard this
reply of the priestess of Apollo, he acknowledged the fault to be
his and not the god's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
The customs of the Lydians differ little from those of the
Greeks. They are the first of all nations we know of that introduced
the art of coining gold and silver; and they were the first
retailers. The Lydians themselves say that the games which are
now common to themselves and the Greeks, were invented by
them during the reign of Atys, when a great scarcity of corn pervaded
all Lydia. For when they saw famine staring them in the
face they sought for remedies, and some devised one thing, some
another; and at that time the games of dice, knucklebones, ball, and
all other kinds of games except draughts, were invented, (for the
Lydians do not claim the invention of this ancient game,) and having
made these inventions to alleviate the famine, they employed
them as follows: they used to play one whole day that they might
not be in want of food; and on the next, they ate and abstained
from play. Thus they passed eighteen years; but when the evil
did not abate, but on the contrary, became still more virulent, their
king divided the whole people into two parts, and cast lots which
should remain and which quit the country, and over that part whose
lot it should be to stay he appointed himself king; and over that
part which was to emigrate he appointed his own son, whose name
was Tyrrhenus. Those to whose lot it fell to leave their country
went down to Smyrna, built ships, and having put all their movables
which were of use on board, set sail in search of food and land, till
having passed by many nations, they reached the Ombrici, where
they built towns, and dwell to this day. From being called Lydians,
they changed their name to one after the king's son, who led
them out; from him they gave themselves the appellation of
Tyrrhenians.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>HISTORY OF THE MEDES TO THE REIGN OF CYRUS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> history hence proceeds to inquire who Cyrus was that overthrew
the power of Crœsus, and how the Persians became masters
of Asia. In which narration I shall follow those Persians, who do
not wish to magnify the actions of Cyrus, but to relate the plain
truth; though I am aware that there are three other ways of relating
Cyrus's history. After the Assyrians had ruled over Upper
Asia five hundred and twenty years, the Medes first began to revolt
from them; and they it seems, in their struggle with the Assyrians
for liberty, proved themselves brave men; and having
shaken off the yoke, became free: afterward the other nations
also did the same as the Medes. When all throughout the continent
were independent, they were again reduced under a despotic
government. There was among the Medes a man famous for
wisdom, named Deioces, son of Phraortes. This Deioces, aiming at
absolute power, had recourse to the following plan. The Medes
were at that time distributed into villages, and Deioces, who was
already highly esteemed in his own district, applied himself with
great zeal to the exercise of justice; and this he did, since great
lawlessness prevailed throughout the whole of Media, and he knew
that injustice and justice are ever at variance. The Medes of the
same village, observing his conduct, chose him for their judge; and
he, constantly keeping the sovereign power in view, showed himself
upright and just. By this conduct he acquired no slight praise
from his fellow citizens, so much so that the inhabitants of other
villages, hearing that Deioces was the only one who judged uprightly,
having before met with unjust sentences, when they heard
of him gladly came from all parts to Deioces, in order to submit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
their quarrels to his decision; and at last they would commit the
decision to no one else. In the end, when the number of those
who had recourse to him continually increased as men heard of the
justice of his decisions, Deioces, seeing the whole devolved upon
himself, would no longer occupy the seat where he used to sit to
determine differences, and refused to act as judge any more, for it
was of no advantage to him to neglect his own affairs, and spend
the day in deciding the quarrels of others. Upon this, rapine and
lawlessness growing far more frequent throughout the villages than
before, the Medes called an assembly and consulted together about
the present state of things, but, as I suspect, the partisans of Deioces
spoke to the following purpose: "Since it is impossible for us to
inhabit the country if we continue in our present condition, let us
constitute a king over us, and so the country will be governed by
good laws, and we ourselves shall be able to attend to our business,
nor be any longer driven from our homes by lawlessness." By
some such words they persuaded them to submit to a kingly government.
Upon their immediately putting the question, whom
they should appoint king, Deioces was unanimously preferred and
commended: so that at last they agreed that he should be their
king. But he required them to build him a palace suitable to the
dignity of a king, and give him guards for security of his person.
The Medes accordingly did so: and built him a strong and spacious
palace in the part of the country that he selected, and permitted
him to choose guards for his person out of all the Medes. Being
thus possessed of the power, he compelled the Medes to build one
city, and having carefully adorned that, to pay less attention to the
others. As the Medes obeyed him in this also, he built lofty and
strong walls, which now go under the name of Ecbatana,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
one placed in a circle within the other; and this fortification was so contrived,
that each circle was raised above the other by the height of
the battlements only. The situation of the ground, rising by an
easy ascent, was very favorable to the design. There were seven
circles altogether, the king's palace and the treasury, situated within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
the innermost of them. The largest of these walls was about equal
in circumference to the city of Athens; the battlements of the first
circle were white, of the second black, of the third purple, of the
fourth blue, of the fifth bright red. Thus the battlements of all
circles were painted with different colors; but the two last had
their battlements plated, the one with silver, the other with gold.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Deioces then built these fortifications for himself, and round his
own palace; and he commanded the rest of the people to fix their
habitations round the fortification; and when all the buildings were
completed he, for the first time, established the following regulations:
that no man should be admitted to the king's presence, but
every one should consult him by means of messengers, and, moreover,
that it should be accounted indecency for any one to laugh
or spit before him. He established such ceremony about his own
person, in order that those who were brought up with him, and of
no meaner family, nor inferior to him in manly qualities, might not,
when they saw him, grieve and conspire against him; but that he
might appear to be of a different nature to those who did not see
him. When he had established these regulations, and settled himself
in the tyranny, he was very severe in the distribution of justice.
And the parties contending were obliged to send him their case
in writing. All other things were regulated by him: so that, if he
received information that any man had injured another, he would
send for him, and punish him in proportion to his offence. For
this purpose he had spies and eaves-droppers in every part of his
dominions.</p>

<p>Now Deioces collected the Medes into one nation, and ruled
over it. The following are the tribes of the Medes, the Busæ, Parataceni,
Struchates, Arizanti, Budii, and the Magi. Deioces had a
son, Phraortes, who, when his father died, after a reign of fifty-three
years, succeeded him in the kingdom; but having so succeeded,
he was not content to rule over the Medes only, but made
war on the Persians, and reduced them under the dominion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
Medes. And afterward being master of these two nations, both
of them powerful, he subdued Asia, attacking one nation after
another; till at last he invaded the Assyrians, who inhabited the
city of Nineveh, and having made war on them, perished with the
greater part of his army, after he had reigned twenty-two
years.</p>

<p>When Phraortes was dead, Cyaxares his son, grandson of
Deioces, succeeded him. He is said to have been more warlike
than his ancestors. He was the first to divide the people of Asia
into cohorts, and then into spearmen, archers, and cavalry; whereas
before they had been confusedly mixed together. It was he
that fought with the Lydians, when the day was turned into night,
as they were fighting; and who subjected the whole of Asia above
the river Halys. He assembled the forces of all his subjects, and
marched against Nineveh to avenge his father, and destroy that
city. He took Nineveh (how they took it, I will relate in another

work),<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
and reduced the Assyrians into subjection, with the exception
of the Babylonian district. Having accomplished these things,
Cyaxares died, after a reign of forty years.</p>

</div>

<p>Astyages the son of Cyaxares succeeded him in the kingdom.
He had a daughter, to whom he gave the name of Mandane.
When she arrived at a marriageable age he gave her to no one of
the Medes who was worthy of her, but to a Persian, named Cambyses,
whom he found descended of a good family, and of a peaceful
disposition, deeming him far superior to a Mede of moderate
rank. In the first year after Mandane was married to Cambyses,
Astyages saw a vision: it appeared to him that a vine sprang
from his daughter, and spread over all Asia. Having seen this
and communicated it to the interpreters of dreams, he sent to
Persia for his daughter, and her son the infant Cyrus, and upon her
arrival he put her under a guard, resolving to destroy her child,
for the Magian interpreters had signified to him from his vision,
that the issue of his daughter would reign in his stead. Astyages
therefore, sent for Harpagus, a kinsman of his, and the most faithful
of all the Medes, and the manager of all his affairs, and said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
him: "Harpagus, on no account fail to perform the business I now
charge you with; nor expose me to danger by deceiving me; nor,
by preferring another, draw ruin upon thy own head. Take the
child of Mandane carry him to your own house and kill him,
and afterward bury him in whatever way you think fit." Harpagus
answered: "O king, you have never yet observed any ingratitude
in me, and I shall take care never to offend you for the future. If
it is your pleasure that this thing should be done, it is fitting that
I readily obey you." Harpagus, having given this answer, when
the child had been put into his hands, adorned as if for death, returned
home weeping; and upon his arrival he told his wife all
that Astyages had said. She asked him, "What then do you purpose
to do?" He answered: "Not as Astyages has commanded;
though he should be yet more outrageous and mad than he is, I will
not comply with his wishes, nor will I submit to him by performing
such a murder: and for many reasons I will not murder the child;
both because he is my own relation, and because Astyages is old,
and has no male offspring; besides, if, after his death, the sovereignty
should devolve on his daughter, whose son he would now
murder by my means, what else remains for me but the greatest
danger? It is necessary, however, for my safety that the child
should die, but as necessary that one of Astyages' people should be
the executioner, and not one of mine." He accordingly sent a
messenger for one of Astyages' herdsmen, who he knew grazed
his cattle on pastures most convenient for the purpose, and on
mountains abounding with wild beasts. His name was Mitradates,
and he had married his fellow-servant. The foot of the mountains
at which this herdsman grazed his cattle, lies to the north of Ecbatana,
toward the Euxine Sea. For the Medic territory on this side
toward the Saspires, is very mountainous, lofty, and covered with
forests; while all the rest of Media is level. When the herdsman,
summoned in great haste, arrived, Harpagus addressed him as
follows: "Astyages bids thee take this infant, and expose him on
the bleakest part of the mountains, that he may speedily perish;
and has charged me to add, that if thou by any means shouldst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
save the child, thou shalt die by the most cruel death; and I am
appointed to see the child exposed." The herdsman, having
heard these words, took the infant, returned by the same way, and
reached his cottage. It so happened that an infant of his own lay
dead at home. When he returned and came up to his wife she
asked him why Harpagus had sent for him in such haste. "Wife,"
said he, "when I reached the city, I saw and heard what I wish I
had never seen, nor had ever befallen our masters. The whole
house of Harpagus was filled with lamentations; I, greatly alarmed,
went in, and as soon as I entered, I saw an infant lying before me,
panting and crying, dressed in gold and a robe of various colors.
Harpagus bade me to take up the child directly, and carry him
away, and expose him in the part of the mountain most frequented
by wild beasts; telling me at the same time, that it was Astyages
who imposed this task on me, and threatening the severest punishment
if I should fail to do it. I took up the infant and carried him
away, supposing him to belong to one of the servants; for I had
then no suspicion whence he came; though I was astonished at
seeing him dressed in gold and fine apparel; and also at the sorrow
which evidently prevailed in the house of Harpagus. But
soon after, on my way home, I learnt the whole truth, from a servant
who accompanied me out of the city, and delivered the child
into my hands; that he was born of Mandane, Astyages' daughter,
and of Cambyses son of Cyrus, and that Astyages had commanded
him to be put to death."</p>

<p>As the herdsman uttered these last words, he uncovered the
child, and showed it to his wife; she seeing that the child was
large and of a beautiful form, embraced the knees of her husband,
and with tears besought him by no means to expose it. He said
that it was impossible to do otherwise; for spies would come from
Harpagus to see the thing done, and he must himself die the most
cruel death if he should fail to do it. "Since, then" said she "I cannot
persuade you not to expose the child, do this: take our own
dead child and expose it, and let us bring up the son of Astyages'
daughter as our own. Thus you will neither be convicted of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
having wronged our masters, nor shall we have consulted ill for
our own interests; for the child that is dead will have a royal
burial, and the one that survives will not be deprived of life." The
herdsman, happy at the suggestion of his wife, gave to her the
child that he had brought for the purpose of putting to death, and
his own, which was dead, he put into the basket in which he had
brought the other, and having dressed it in all the finery of the
other child, exposed it in the most desolate part of the mountains.
On the third day after the infant had been exposed, the herdsman,
having left one of his assistants as a guard, went to the city, and
arriving at the house of Harpagus, told him he was ready to show
the dead body of the infant. Harpagus accordingly sent some of
the most trusty of his guards, and by that means saw the body, and
buried the herdsman's child. The other, who afterwards had the
name of Cyrus, was brought up by the herdsman's wife, who gave
him some other name, and not that of Cyrus.</p>

<p>When the child attained the age of ten years, the following
circumstance discovered him. He was playing in the village in
which the ox-stalls were, with boys of his own age in the road.
The boys had chosen this reputed son of the herdsman for their
king. He in sport appointed some of them to build houses, and
others to be his body-guards; one of them to be the king's eye,
and to another he gave the office of bringing messages to him,
assigning to each his proper duty. One of these boys who was
playing with him, son of Artembares, a man of rank among the
Medes, refused to obey the orders of Cyrus; he therefore commanded
the others to seize him, and when they obeyed, Cyrus
scourged the boy very severely. But the boy, as soon as he was
let loose, considering that he had been treated with great indignity,
took it very much to heart, and hastening to the city, complained
to his father of the treatment he had met with from the
son of Astyages' herdsman. Artembares, in a transport of anger,
went immediately to Astyages, and taking his son with him, said
that he suffered treatment that was not to be borne, adding,
"Thus, O king, are we insulted by your slave, the son of a herdsman;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
showing the boy's shoulders. Astyages having heard and
seen what was done, resolving, on account of the rank of Artembares,
to avenge the indignity offered to the youth, sent for the
herdsman and his son. When both came into his presence, Astyages,
looking upon Cyrus, said: "Have you, who are the son
of such a man as this, dared to treat the son of one of the principal
persons in my kingdom with such indignity?" But Cyrus
answered: "Sir, I treated him as I did with justice. For the
boys of our village, of whom he was one, in their play made me
their king, because I appeared to them the most fitted for that
office. All the other boys performed what they were ordered, but
he refused to obey and paid no attention to my commands, so he
was punished: if I deserve punishment for this here I am ready to
submit to it." As the boy spoke Astyages recognised him; the
character of his face appeared like his own, and his answer more
free than accorded with his condition; the time also of the exposure
seemed to agree with the age of the boy. Alarmed at this
discovery, he was for some time speechless; and at last, having
with difficulty recovered himself (being desirous of sending Artembares
away in order that he might examine the herdsman in private),
he said: "Artembares, I will take care that neither you nor
your son shall have any cause of complaint," and dismissed him; but
the servants, at the command of Astyages, conducted Cyrus into
an inner room; and when the herdsman remained alone, he asked
him in the absence of witnesses, whence he had the boy, and from
whose hands he received him? He affirmed that the boy was his
own son, and that the mother who bore him was still living with
him. Astyages told him, that he did not consult his own safety in
wishing to be put to the torture; and as he said this he made a
signal to his guards to seize him. The man, when brought to the
torture, discovered the whole matter, speaking the truth throughout;
and concluded with prayers and entreaties for pardon. Astyages,
when the herdsman had confessed the truth, did not concern
himself much about him afterwards; but attaching great blame to
Harpagus, he ordered his guards to summon him; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
Astyages asked, "Harpagus, by what kind of death did you dispose
of the child which I delivered to you, born of my daughter?"
Harpagus, seeing the herdsman present, had not recourse to falsehood,
lest he should be detected and convicted, but said, "O king,
when I had received the infant, I carefully considered how I could
act according to your wish and command, and, without offending
you, I might be free from the crime of murder both in your
daughter's sight and in yours. I therefore sent for this herdsman
and gave him the child, saying that you had commanded him to
put it to death, and in saying this I did not speak falsely, for such
indeed were your orders. In this manner I delivered the infant to
him, charging him to place it in some desert mountain, and to stay
and watch till the child was dead, threatening the severest punishment
if he should not fully carry out these injunctions. When he
had executed these orders, and the child was dead, I sent some of
the most trusty of my servants, and by means of them beheld the
body, and buried it. This is the whole truth, O king, and such
was the fate of the child."</p>

<p>Thus Harpagus told the real truth; but Astyages, dissembling
the anger which he felt on account of what had been done, again
related to Harpagus the whole matter as he had heard it from the
herdsman; and afterwards, when he had repeated it throughout,
he ended by saying that the child was alive and all was well.
"For," he added, "I suffered much on account of what had been
done regarding this child, and could not easily bear the reproaches
of my daughter; therefore, since fortune has taken a more favorable
turn, do you, in the first place, send your own son to accompany
the boy I have recovered; and, in the next place, (for I propose
to offer a sacrifice for the preservation of the child to the
gods, to whom that honor is due), do you be with me at supper."</p>

<p>Harpagus on hearing these words, when he had paid his homage,
and had congratulated himself that his fault had turned to so good
account, and that he was invited to the feast under such auspicious
circumstances, went to his own home. And as soon as he entered
he sent his only son, who was about thirteen years of age, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
bade him go to Astyages, and do whatever he should command;
and then, being full of joy, he told his wife what had happened.
But when the son of Harpagus arrived, having slain him and cut
him into joints, Astyages roasted some parts of his flesh and boiled
others, and having had them well dressed, kept them in readiness.
At the appointed hour, when the other guests and Harpagus were
come, tables full of mutton were placed before the rest and Astyages
himself, but before Harpagus all the body of his son, except the
head, the hands and the feet; these were laid apart in a basket
covered over. When Harpagus seemed to have eaten enough,
Astyages asked him if he was pleased with the entertainment;
and when Harpagus replied that he was highly delighted, the
officers appointed for that purpose brought him the head of his son
covered up with the hands and feet, and standing before Harpagus,
they bade him uncover the basket and take what he chose. Harpagus
doing as they desired, and uncovering the basket, saw the remains
of his son's body, but he expressed no alarm at the sight,
and retained his presence of mind; whereupon Astyages asked
him if he knew of what animal he had been eating. He said he
knew very well, and that whatever a king did was agreeable to
him. After he had given this answer he gathered the remains of
the flesh and went home, purposing, as I conjecture, to collect
all that he could and bury it.</p>

<p>Astyages thus punished Harpagus; and then, considering what
he should do with Cyrus, summoned the Magi, who had formerly
interpreted his dream. When they were come, Astyages asked
them in what way they had interpreted his vision. They gave the
same answer as before; and said that if the boy was still alive,
and had not already died, he must of necessity be king. He answered
them as follows: "The boy still survives, and while
living in the country, the boys of the village made him king, and
he has already performed all such things as kings really do, for he
has appointed guards, door-keepers, messengers, and all other things
in like manner; and now I desire to know to what do these things
appear to you to tend." The Magi answered, "If the boy be living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
and has already been a king by no settled plan, you may take
courage on his account and make your mind easy, for he will not
reign a second time. For some of our predictions terminate in
trifling results; and dreams, and things like them, are fulfilled by
slight events." To this Astyages replied: "I too, O Magi, am
very much of the same opinion, that since the child has been
named king, the dream is accomplished, and that the boy is no
longer an object of alarm to me; yet consider well, and carefully
weigh what will be the safest course for my family and yourselves."
The Magi answered: "O king, it is of great importance to us that
your empire should be firmly established, for otherwise it is alienated,
passing over to this boy, who is a Persian, and we, who are
Medes, shall be enslaved by Persians, and held in no account as
being foreigners; whereas while you, who are of our own country,
are king, we have a share in the government, and enjoy great
honors at your hands. Thus, then, we must on every account
provide for your safety and that of your government; and now if
we saw any thing to occasion alarm we should tell you of it beforehand;
but now, since the dream has issued in a trifling event, we
ourselves take courage, and advise you to do the like, and to send
the boy out of your sight to his parents in Persia." When Astyages
heard this he was delighted, and, calling for Cyrus, said to him:
"Child, I have been unjust to you, by reason of a vain dream; but
you survive by your own destiny. Now go in happiness to Persia,
and I will send an escort to attend you; when you arrive there you
will find a father and mother very different from the herdsman
Mitradates and his wife."</p>

<p>Astyages thus sent Cyrus away, and, upon his arrival at the
house of Cambyses, his parents received him with the greatest tenderness
and joy, having been assured that he had died immediately
after his birth; and they inquired of him by what means his life
had been preserved. He told them, that till that time he believed
he was the son of Astyages' herdsman. He related that he had
been brought up by the herdsman's wife; and he went on constantly
praising her.</p>

    <p>EGYPTIAN HARE.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Cyrus had reached man's estate, and proved the most
manly and beloved of his equals in age, Harpagus paid great
court to him, sending him presents, from his desire to be
avenged on Astyages; for he did not see that he himself, who
was but a private man, could be able to take vengeance on Astyages;
perceiving, therefore, that Cyrus was growing up to be his
avenger, he contracted a friendship with him, comparing the sufferings
of Cyrus with his own. And before this he had made the
following preparations. Seeing Astyages severe in his treatment
of the Medes, Harpagus holding intercourse with the chief persons
of the nation, one after another, persuaded them that they ought
to place him at their head, and depose Astyages. When he had
effected his purpose, and all was ready, Harpagus, wishing to discover
his designs to Cyrus, who resided in Persia, and having no
other way left, because the roads were all guarded, contrived the
following artifice. Having cunningly contrived a hare, by opening
its belly, and tearing off none of the hair, he put a letter, containing
what he thought necessary to write, into the body; and having
sewed up the belly of the hare, he gave it with some nets to the
most trusty of his servants, dressed as a hunter, and sent him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
Persia; having by word of mouth commanded him to bid Cyrus,
as he gave him the hare, to open it with his own hand, and not to
suffer any one to be present when he did so. This was accordingly
done, and Cyrus having received the hare, opened it; and
found the letter which was in it, to the following purport: "Son of
Cambyses, seeing the gods watch over you, (for otherwise you
could never have arrived at your present fortune), do you now
avenge yourself on your murderer Astyages; for as far as regards
his purpose you are long since dead, but by the care of the gods
and of me you survive. I suppose you have been long since informed
both what was done regarding yourself, and what I suffered
at the hands of Astyages, because I did not put you to death, but
gave you to the herdsman. Then, if you will follow my counsel,
you shall rule over the whole territory that Astyages now governs.
Persuade the Persians to revolt, and invade Media; and whether
I or any other illustrious Mede be appointed to command the army
opposed to you, every thing will turn out as you wish; for they,
on the first onset, having revolted from him, and siding with you,
will endeavor to depose him. Since, then, every thing is ready
here, do as I advise, and do it quickly."</p>

<p>Cyrus, upon receiving this intelligence, began to consider by
what measures he could best persuade the Persians to revolt.
Having written such a letter as he thought fit, he called an assembly
of the Persians, read the letter and said that Astyages had
appointed him general of the Persians: "Now," he continued,
"I require you to attend me, every man with a sickle." When all
had come with their sickles, as had been ordered, Cyrus selected a
tract of land in Persia, about eighteen or twenty stadia square
(nearly two and one half miles), which was overgrown with briers,
and directed them to clear it during the day: when the Persians
had finished the appointed task, he bade them come again on the
next day, washed and well attired. In the meantime Cyrus collected
all his father's flocks and herds, had them killed and dressed,
to entertain the Persian forces, and provided wine and bread in
abundance. The next day, when the Persians had assembled, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
made them lie down on the turf, and feasted them; and, after the
repast was over, asked them whether the treatment they had
received the day before, or the present, was preferable. They
answered, that the difference was great; for on the preceding day
they had every hardship, but on the present everything that was
good. Then Cyrus discovered his intentions, and said: "Men of
Persia, the case stands thus; if you will hearken to me, you may
enjoy these, and numberless other advantages, without any kind
of servile labor; but if you will not hearken to me, innumerable
hardships, like those of yesterday, await you. Now, therefore,
obey me, and be free; for I am persuaded I am born by divine
providence to undertake this work; and I deem you to be men
in no way inferior to the Medes, either in other respects or in war;
then revolt with all speed from Astyages."</p>

<p>The Persians under such a leader, gladly asserted their freedom,
having for a long time felt indignant at being governed by the
Medes. Astyages, informed of what Cyrus was doing, sent a
messenger and summoned him; but Cyrus bade the messenger
take back word, "that he would come to him sooner than Astyages
desired." When Astyages heard this, he armed all the
Medes; and, as if the gods had deprived him of understanding,
made Harpagus their general, utterly forgetting the outrage he
had done him. And when the Medes came to an engagement
with the Persians, such of them as knew nothing of the plot,
fought; but others went over to the Persians; and the far greater
part purposely behaved as cowards and fled. As soon as the news
was brought to Astyages that the Medes were thus shamefully dispersed,
he exclaimed: "Not even so shall Cyrus have occasion to
rejoice." His first act was to impale the Magi, who had interpreted
his dream, and advised him to let Cyrus go; then he armed
all the Medes that were left in the city, old and young; and leading
them out, engaged the Persians, and was defeated. Astyages
himself was made prisoner, and lost all the Medes whom he had
led out. Harpagus, standing by Astyages after he was taken,
exulted over him and jeered at him; and among other galling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
words, he asked him about the supper, at which he had feasted
him with his son's flesh, and inquired, "how he liked slavery in
exchange for a kingdom." Astyages, looking steadfastly on Harpagus,
asked in return, whether he thought himself the author of
Cyrus's success. Harpagus said, he did, for, as he had written,
the achievement was justly due to himself. Astyages thereupon
proved him to be "the weakest and most unjust of all men; the
weakest, in giving the kingdom to another, which he might have
assumed to himself, if indeed he had effected this change; and the
most unjust, because he had enslaved the whole nation of the
Medes on account of the supper."</p>

<p>So Astyages, after he had reigned thirty-five years, was deposed.
But Cyrus kept him with him till he died, without doing
him any further injury. Thus did Cyrus come to the throne, conquer
Crœsus, and become master of all Asia.</p>

<p>The Persians, according to my own knowledge, observe the
following customs:&mdash;It is not their practice to erect statues, or
temples, or altars, but they charge those with folly who do so; because,
as I conjecture, they do not think the gods have human
forms, as the Greeks do. They are accustomed to ascend the
highest parts of the mountains, and offer sacrifice to Jupiter, and
they call the whole circle of the heavens by the name of Jupiter.
They sacrifice to the sun and moon, to the earth, fire, water, and
the winds. To these alone they sacrificed in the earliest times:
but they have since learnt from the Arabians and Assyrians to sacrifice
to Venus Urania, whom the Assyrians call Venus Mylitta,
the Arabians, Alitta, and the Persians Mitra. They do not erect
altars nor kindle fires when about to sacrifice; they do not use
libations, or flutes, or fillets, or cakes; but, when any one wishes
to offer sacrifice to any one of these deities, he leads the victim to
a clean spot, and invokes the god, usually having his tiara decked
with myrtle. He that sacrifices is not permitted to pray for blessings
for himself alone; but he is obliged to offer prayers for the
prosperity of all the Persians, and the king, for he is himself included
in the Persians. When he has cut the victim into small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
pieces, and boiled the flesh, he strews under it a bed of tender
grass, generally trefoil, and then lays all the flesh upon it; when
he has put every thing in order, one of the Magi standing by sings
an ode concerning the original of the gods, which they say is the
incantation; and without one of the Magi it is not lawful for them
to sacrifice. After having waited a short time, he that has sacrificed
carries away the flesh and disposes of it as he thinks fit. It
is their custom to honor their birthday above all other days; and
on this day they furnish their table in a more plentiful manner than
at other times. The rich then produce an ox, a horse, a camel, and
an ass, roasted whole in an oven; but the poor produce smaller
cattle. They are moderate at their meals, but eat of many after-dishes,
and those not served up together. On this account the
Persians say, "that the Greeks rise hungry from the table, because
nothing worth mentioning is brought in after dinner, and that if
anything were brought in, they would not leave off eating." The
Persians are much addicted to wine. They are accustomed to debate
the most important affairs when intoxicated; but whatever
they have determined on in such deliberation, is on the following
day, when they are sober, proposed to them by the master of the
house where they have met to consult; and if they approve of it
when sober also, then they adopt it; if not, they reject it. And
whatever they have first resolved on when sober, they reconsider
when intoxicated. When they meet one another in the streets,
one may discover by the following custom, whether those who
meet are equals. For instead of accosting one another, they kiss
on the mouth; if one be a little inferior to the other, they kiss the
cheek; but if he be of a much lower rank, he prostrates himself
before the other.</p>

<p>The Persians are of all nations the most ready to adopt foreign
customs; for they wear the Medic costume, thinking it handsomer
than their own; and in war they use the Egyptian cuirass. From
the age of five years to twenty, they instruct their sons in three
things only: to ride, to use the bow, and to speak the truth. Before
he is five years of age, a son is not admitted to the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
of his father, but lives entirely with the women: the reason of this
custom is, that if he should die in childhood, he may occasion no
grief to his father.</p>

<p>Now I much approve of the above custom, as also of the following,
that not even the king is allowed to put any one to death for
a single crime, nor any private Persian exercise extreme severity
against any of his domestics for one fault, but if on examination he
should find that his misdeeds are more numerous and greater than
his services, he may in that case give vent to his anger. They say
that no one ever yet killed his own father or mother. To tell a
lie is considered by them the greatest disgrace; next to that, to be
in debt; for the reason that one who is in debt must of necessity
tell lies. Whosoever of the citizens has the leprosy or scrofula, is
not permitted to stay within a town, nor to have communication
with other Persians; and they say that a man is afflicted with
these diseases from having committed some offence against the
sun. Every stranger that is seized with these distempers they
drive out of the country; and they do the same to white pigeons,
making the same charge against them. They neither spit, nor
wash their hands in a river, but pay extreme veneration to all
rivers. Another circumstance is also peculiar to them which has
escaped the notice of the Persians themselves, but not of us. Their
names, which correspond with their personal forms and their rank,
all terminate in the same letter (s) which the Dorians call <i>San</i>, and
the Ionians <i>Sigma</i>. If you inquire into this you will find, that all
Persian names, without exception, end in the same letter. These
things I can with certainty affirm to be true, since I myself know
them. But what follows, relating to the dead, is only secretly mentioned,
viz.: that the dead body of a Persian is never buried until
it has been torn by some bird or dog; but I know for a certainty
that the Magi do this, for they do it openly. The Persians then,
having covered the body with wax, conceal it in the ground. The
Magi differ very much from all other men, and particularly from
the Egyptian priests, for the latter hold it matter of religion not to
kill any thing that has life, except such things as they offer in sacrifice;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
whereas the Magi kill every thing with their own hands,
except a dog or a man; and they think they do a meritorious
thing, when they kill ants, serpents, and other reptiles and
birds.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>THE ASIATIC GREEKS AND THE LYDIAN REVOLT.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Ionians and Æolians, as soon as the Lydians were subdued
by the Persians, sent ambassadors to Cyrus at Sardis, wishing
to become subject to him, on the same terms as they had been
to Crœsus. But, when he heard their proposal, he told them this
story: "A piper seeing some fishes in the sea, began to pipe,
expecting that they would come to shore; but finding his hopes
disappointed, he took a casting-net, with which he caught a great
number of fishes, and drew them out. When he saw them leaping
about, he said to the fishes: 'Cease your dancing, since when I
piped you would not come out and dance.'" Cyrus told this story
to the Ionians and Æolians, because the Ionians, when Cyrus
pressed them by his ambassador to revolt from Crœsus, refused to
consent, and now, when the business was done, were ready to
listen to him. When the Ionians heard this message, they severally
fortified themselves with walls, and met together at the Panionium,
with the exception of the Milesians; for Cyrus made an alliance
with them on the same terms as the Lydians had done. The
rest of the Ionians resolved unanimously to send ambassadors to
Sparta, to implore them to succor the Ionians. These Ionians, to
whom the Panionium belongs, have built their cities under the
finest sky and climate of the world that we know of; for neither
the regions that are above it, nor those that are below, nor the
parts to the east or west, are at all equal to Ionia; for some of
them are oppressed by cold and rain, others by heat and drought.
These Ionians do not all use the same language, but have four
varieties of dialect. Miletus, the first of them, lies toward the
south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
The Milesians were sheltered from danger, as they had made
an alliance. The islanders also had nothing to fear; for the
Phœnicians were not yet subject to the Persians, nor were the
Persians themselves at all acquainted with maritime affairs. Now
the Milesians had seceded from the rest of the Ionians only for
this reason, that weak as the Grecian race then was, the Ionian
was weakest of all, and of least account; for except Athens, there
was no other city of note. The other Ionians, therefore, and the
Athenians shunned the name, and would not be called Ionians;
and even now many of them appear to me to be ashamed of the
name. But these twelve cities gloried in the name, and built a
temple for their own use, to which they gave the name of Panionium.</p>

<p>When the ambassadors of the Ionians and Æolians arrived at
Sparta, they made choice of a Phocæan, whose name was Pythermus,
to speak in behalf of all. Putting on a purple robe, in order
that as many as possible of the Spartans might hear of it and
assemble, he addressed them at length, imploring their assistance.
But the Lacedæmonians would not listen to him, and determined
not to assist the Ionians: they therefore returned home. Yet the
Lacedæmonians, though they had rejected the Ionian ambassadors,
despatched men in a penteconter, to keep an eye upon the
affairs of Cyrus and Ionia. These men arriving in Phocæa, sent
the most eminent person among them, whose name was Lacrines,
to Sardis, to warn Cyrus in the name of the Lacedæmonians, "not
to injure any city on the Grecian territory, for in that case they
would not pass it by unnoticed." When the herald gave this
message, it is related that Cyrus inquired of the Greeks who were
present, who the Lacedæmonians were, and how many in number,
that they sent him such a warning. And when informed, he said
to the Spartan herald, "I was never yet afraid of those, who in the
midst of their city have a place set apart, in which they collect and
cheat one another by false oaths; and if I continue in health, not
the calamities of the Ionians shall be talked about, but their own."
This taunt of Cyrus was levelled at the Greeks in general, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
have markets for the purposes of buying and selling; for the Persians
have no such a thing as a market. After this, Cyrus intrusted
Tabalus a Persian with the government of Sardis, and
appointed Pactyas a Lydian to bring away the gold, both that
belonging to Crœsus and to the other Lydians, and departed with
Cyrus for Ecbatana, for from the first he took no account of the
Ionians. But Babylon was an obstacle to him, as were also the
Bactrians, the Sacæ, and the Egyptians; against whom he resolved
to lead an army in person, and to send some other general against
the Ionians. But as soon as Cyrus had marched from Sardis,
Pactyas prevailed on the Lydians to revolt from Tabalus and
Cyrus; and going down to the sea-coast, with all the gold taken
from Sardis in his possession, he hired mercenaries and persuaded
the inhabitants of the coast to join him; and then having marched
against Sardis, he besieged Tabalus, who was shut up in the
citadel.</p>

<p>When Cyrus heard this news on his march, he said to Crœsus;</p>

<p>"Crœsus, what will be the end of these things? the Lydians,
it seems, will never cease to give trouble to me, and to themselves.
I am in doubt whether it will not be better to reduce
them to slavery; for I appear to have acted like one who, having
killed the father, has spared the children; so I am carrying away
you, who have been something more than a father to the Lydians,
and have intrusted their city to the Lydians themselves: and then
I wonder at their rebellion!" Crœsus, fearing lest he should
utterly destroy Sardis, answered: "Sir, you have but too much
reason for what you say; yet do not give full vent to your anger,
nor utterly destroy an ancient city, which is innocent as well of
the former as of the present offence: for of the former I myself
was guilty, and now bear the punishment on my own head; but in
the present instance Pactyas, to whom you intrusted Sardis, is the
culprit; let him therefore pay the penalty. But pardon the Lydians,
and enjoin them to observe the following regulations, to the
end that they may never more revolt, nor be troublesome to you:
send to them and order them to keep no weapons of war in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
possession; and enjoin them to wear tunics under their cloaks, and
buskins on their feet; and require them to teach their sons to play
on the cithara, to strike the guitar, and to sell by retail; and then
you will soon see them becoming women instead of men, so that
they will never give you any apprehensions about their revolting."
Crœsus suggested this plan, thinking it would be more desirable
for the Lydians, than that they should be sold for slaves; and
being persuaded, that unless he could suggest some feasible proposal,
he should not prevail with him to alter his resolution: and
he dreaded also, that the Lydians, if they should escape the
present danger, might hereafter revolt from the Persians, and
bring utter ruin on themselves. Cyrus, pleased with the expedient,
laid aside his anger, and said that he would follow his advice: then
having sent for Mazares, a Mede, he commanded him to order the
Lydians to conform themselves to the regulations proposed by
Crœsus, and moreover to enslave all the rest who had joined the
Lydians in the attack on Sardis; but by all means to bring Pactyas
to him alive. Cyrus having given these orders on his way, proceeded
to the settlements of the Persians. But Pactyas heard that the army
which was coming against him was close at hand, and fled in great
consternation to Cyme. Mazares marched against Sardis with an
inconsiderable division of Cyrus's army, but found that Pactyas and
his party were no longer there. He, however, compelled the
Lydians to conform to the injunctions of Cyrus; who, by his order,
completely changed their mode of life: after this Mazares despatched
messengers to Cyme, requiring them to deliver up Pactyas. But
the Cymæans, in order to come to a decision, resolved to refer the
matter to the deity at Branchidæ, for an oracular shrine was there
erected in former times, which all the Ionians and Æolians were in
the practice of consulting. The Cymæans asked the oracle "what
course they should pursue respecting Pactyas, that would be most
pleasing to the gods:" the answer to their question was, that they
should deliver up Pactyas to the Persians. When this answer was
reported, they determined to give him up; but, Aristodicus the son
of Heraclides, a man of high repute among the citizens, distrusting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
the oracle, and suspecting the sincerity of the consulters, prevented
them from doing so; till at last other messengers, among whom
was Aristodicus, went to inquire a second time concerning Pactyas.
When they arrived at Branchidæ, Aristodicus consulted the oracle
in the name of all, inquiring in these words: "O king, Pactyas, a
Lydian, has come to us as a suppliant, to avoid a violent death at
the hands of the Persians. They now demand him, and require
the Cymæans to give him up. We, however, though we dread the
Persian power, have not yet dared to surrender the suppliant, till it
be plainly declared by thee what we ought to do." The oracle
gave the same answer as before. Upon this Aristodicus deliberately
acted as follows; walking round the temple, he took away all
the sparrows and all other kinds of birds that had built nests in the
temple; whereupon a voice issued from the sanctuary; addressing
Aristodicus, it spoke as follows: "O most impious of men, how
darest thou do this? Dost thou tear my suppliants from my
temple?" Aristodicus without hesitation answered, "O king, art
thou then so careful to succor thy suppliants, but biddest the
Cymæans to deliver up theirs?" The oracle again rejoined:
"Yes, I bid you do so; that having acted impiously, ye may the
sooner perish, and never more come and consult the oracle about
the delivering up of suppliants." When the Cymæans heard this
latter answer, not wishing to bring destruction on themselves by
surrendering Pactyas, or to subject themselves to a siege by protecting
him, they sent him away to Mitylene. But the Mitylenæans,
when Mazares sent a message to them requiring them to deliver up
Pactyas, were preparing to do so for some remuneration; what, I
am unable to say precisely, for the proposal was never completed.
For the Cymæans, being informed of what was being done by the
Mitylenæans, despatched a vessel to Lesbos, and transported
Pactyas to Chios, whence he was torn by violence from the temple
of Minerva Poliuchus by the Chians, and delivered up. The Chians
delivered him up in exchange for Atarneus, a place situate in
Mysia, opposite Lesbos. In this manner Pactyas fell into the hands
of the Persians; who kept him under guard in order that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
might deliver him to Cyrus. For a long time after this, none of
the Chians would offer barley-meal from Atarneus to any of the
gods, or make any cakes of the fruit that came from them; but all
the productions of that country were excluded from the temples.
Mazares, after this, marched against those who had assisted in
besieging Tabalus; and in the first place reduced the Prienians to
slavery, and in the next overran the whole plain of the Mæander,
and gave it to his army to pillage; and he treated Magnesia in the
same manner: but shortly afterward fell sick and died.</p>

<p>On his death Harpagus came down as his successor in the
command; he also was by birth a Mede, the same whom Astyages
king of the Medes entertained at the impious feast, and who
assisted Cyrus in ascending the throne. This man being appointed
general by Cyrus, on his arrival in Ionia, took several cities by
means of earth-works; for he forced the people to retire within their
fortifications, and then, having heaped up mounds against the
walls, he carried the cities by storm. Phocæa was the first place
in Ionia that he attacked.</p>

<p>These Phocæans were the first of all the Greeks who undertook
long voyages, and they are the people who discovered the
Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas, Iberia, and Tartessus.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
They made their voyages in fifty-oared galleys, and not in merchant-ships.
When they arrived at Tartessus they were kindly received by the
king of the Tartessians, whose name was Arganthonius; he
reigned eighty years over Tartessus, and lived to the age of one
hundred and twenty. The Phocæans became such great favorites
with him, that he at first solicited them to abandon Ionia, and to
settle in any part of his territory they should choose; but afterward,
finding he could not prevail with them to accept his offer,
and hearing from them the increasing power of the Mede, he gave
them money for the purpose of building a wall around their city;
he must have given it unsparingly, for the wall is not a few stades
in circumference, and is entirely built of large and well-compacted
stones. When Harpagus had marched his army against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Phocæans, he besieged them, but offered these terms: "that he
would be content if the Phocæans would throw down only one of
their battlements, and consecrate one house <i>to the king's use</i>."
The Phocæans, detesting slavery, said, "that they wished for one
day to deliberate, and would then give their answer"; but while
they were deliberating they required him to draw off his forces
from the wall. Harpagus said, that "though he well knew their
design, yet he would permit them to consult together." In the
interval, then, during which Harpagus withdrew his army from the
wall, the Phocæans launched their fifty-oared galleys, and having
put their wives, children, and goods on board, together with the
images from the temples and other offerings, except works of
bronze or stone, or pictures, they embarked themselves, and set
sail for Chios: and the Persians took possession of Phocæa, abandoned
by all its inhabitants. The Phocæans, when the Chians
refused to sell them the Œnyssæ Islands, for fear they should
become the seat of trade, and their own island be thereby excluded,
directed their course to Cyrnus; where, by the admonition of an
oracle, they had twenty years before built a city, named Alalia.
But Arganthonius was at that time dead. On their passage to
Cyrnus, having first sailed down to Phocæa, they put to death the
Persian garrison which had been left by Harpagus to guard the
city. Afterward, when this was accomplished, they pronounced
terrible imprecations on any who should desert the fleet; besides
this, they sunk a mass of red-hot iron, and swore "that they would
never return to Phocæa, till this burning mass should appear
again." Nevertheless, as they were on their way toward Cyrnus,
more than one half of the citizens were seized with regret and
yearning for their city and dwellings in the country, and violating
their oaths, sailed back to Phocæa; but such of them as kept to
their oath weighed anchor and sailed from the Œnyssæ Islands.
On their arrival at Cyrnus they lived for five years in common
with the former settlers: but as they ravaged the territories of all
their neighbors, the Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians combined together
to make war against them, each with sixty ships: and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
Phocæans, on their part, having manned their ships, consisting of
sixty in number, met them in the Sardinian Sea; and having engaged,
the Phocæans obtained a kind of Cadmean victory;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
for forty of their own ships were destroyed, and the twenty that survived
were disabled, for their prows were blunted. They therefore
sailed back to Alalia, took on board their wives and children, with
what property their ships were able to carry, and leaving Cyrnus,
sailed to Rhegium. As to the men belonging to the ships destroyed,
most of them fell into the hands of the Carthaginians and
Tyrrhenians, who took them on shore and stoned them to death.
But afterward all animals belonging to the Argyllæans that passed
by the spot where the Phocæans who had been stoned lay, became
distorted, maimed, and crippled, as well sheep, as beasts of burden
and men. The Argyllæans, therefore, being anxious to expiate
the guilt, sent to Delphi; and the Pythian enjoined them to use
those rites which they still observe; for they commemorate their
death with great magnificence, and have established gymnastic
and equestrian contests. This was the fate of these Phocæans;
but the others, who fled to Rhegium, left that place, and got possession
of the town in the territory of Œnotria, which is now
called Hyela, which they colonized by the advice of a certain Posidonian,
who told them the Pythia had directed them to establish
sacred rites to Cyrnus as being a hero, but not to colonize the
island of that name.</p>

<p>The Teians also acted nearly in the same manner as the Phocæans.
For when Harpagus by means of his earth-works had
made himself master of their walls, they all went on board their
ships, and sailed away to Thrace, and there settled in the city of
Abdera; which Timesius of Clazomenæ having formerly founded,
did not enjoy, but was driven out by the Thracians, and is now
honored as a hero by the Teians of Abdera.</p>

<p>These were the only Ionians who abandoned their country
rather than submit to servitude. The rest, except the Milesians,
gave battle to Harpagus, and as well as those who abandoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
their country, proved themselves brave men, each fighting for his
own; but defeated and subdued, they remained in their own countries,
and submitted to the commands imposed on them. The
Milesians, as I have before mentioned, having made a league with
Cyrus, remained quiet. So was Ionia a second time enslaved, and
the islanders, dreading the same fate, made their submission to
Cyrus. When the Ionians were brought into this wretched condition,
and nevertheless still held assemblies at Panionium, I am
informed that Bias of Priene gave them most salutary advice,
which, had they harkened to him, would have made them the
most flourishing of all the Greeks. He advised, "that the Ionians,
should sail in one common fleet to Sardinia, and there build one
city for all the Ionians; thus being freed from servitude, they
would flourish, inhabiting the most considerable of the islands, and
governing the rest; whereas if they remained in Ionia, he saw no
hope of recovering their liberty." But before Ionia was ruined,
the suggestion of Thales, the Milesian, who was of Phœnician
extraction, was also good, who advised that the Ionians should
constitute one general council in Teos, which stands in the centre
of Ionia; and that the rest of the inhabited cities should be governed
as independent states.</p>

<p>Harpagus having subdued Ionia, marched against the Carians,
Cannians, Lycians, Ionians, and Æolians; of whom the Carians
were by far the most famous of all nations in those times. They
introduced three inventions which the Greeks have adopted. For
the Carians set the example of fastening crests upon helmets and
of putting devices on shields; they are also the first who attached
handles to shields; until their time all who used shields carried
them without handles, guiding them with leathern thongs, having
them slung round their necks and left shoulders.</p>

<p>The Lycians were originally sprung from Crete, for in ancient
time Crete was entirely in the possession of barbarians. But a
dispute having arisen between Sarpedon and Minos, sons of Europa,
respecting the sovereign power, when Minos got the upper
hand in the struggle, he drove out Sarpedon with his partisans;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
and they being expelled came to the land of Milyas in Asia, and
were afterwards joined by Lycus son of Pandion of Athens, who
was likewise driven out by his brother Ægeus, and came to be
called Lycians after him. Their customs are partly Cretan and
partly Carian; but they have one peculiar to themselves, in which
they differ from all other nations: they take their name from their
mothers and not from their fathers; so that if any one asks another
who he is, he will describe himself by his mother's side, and
reckon his ancestry in the female line. And if a free-born woman
marry a slave, the children are accounted of pure birth; but if a
man though a citizen, and of high rank, marry a foreigner, the
children are considered low born.</p>

<p>All Cnidia, except a small space, is surrounded by water; for
the Ceramic gulf bounds it on the north, and on the south the sea
by Syme and Rhodes: now this small space, which is about five
stades in breadth, the Cnidians, wishing to make their territory
insular, designed to dig through, while Harpagus was subduing
Ionia. For the whole of their dominions were within the isthmus;
and where the Cnidian territory terminates toward the continent,
there is the isthmus that they designed to dig through. But, as
they were carrying on the work with great diligence, the workmen
appeared to be wounded to a greater extent and in a more
strange manner than usual, both in other parts of the body, and
particularly in the eyes, by the chipping of the rock; they therefore
sent deputies to Delphi to inquire what was the cause of the
obstruction; and, as the Cnidians say, the Pythia answered as
follows in trimeter verse: "Build not a tower on the isthmus, nor
dig it through, for Jove would have made it an island had he so
willed." So the Cnidians desisted from their work, and surrendered
without resistance to Harpagus, as soon as he approached
with his army. The Pedasians were situated inland above Halicarnassus.
When any mischief is about to befall them or their
neighbors, the priestess of Minerva has a long beard: this has
three times occurred. These were the only people about Caria
who opposed Harpagus for any time and gave him much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
trouble, by fortifying a mountain called Lyda. After some time,
however, they were subdued. The Lycians, when Harpagus
marched his army toward the Xanthian plain, went out to meet
him, and engaging with very inferior numbers, displayed great
feats of valor. But being defeated and shut up within their city,
they collected their wives, children, property, and servants within
the citadel, and then set fire to it and burnt it to the ground.
When they had done this, and engaged themselves by the strongest
oaths, all the Xanthians went out and died fighting. Of the
modern Lycians, who are said to be Xanthians, all, except eighty
families, are strangers; but these eighty families happened at the
time to be away from home and so survived. Thus Harpagus got
possession of Xanthus and Caunia almost in the same manner;
for the Caunians generally followed the example of the Lycians.</p>

<small>THE CONQUEST OF ASSYRIA AND THE WAR WITH THE MASSAGETÆ.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Harpagus was reducing the lower parts of Asia, Cyrus
had conquered the upper parts, subduing every nation without exception.
The greatest parts of these I shall pass by without notice;
but I will make mention of those which gave him most trouble,
and are most worthy of being recorded.</p>

<p>Assyria contains many large cities, the most renowned and the
strongest of which, where the seat of government was established
after the destruction of Nineveh, was Babylon, which is of the following
description. The city stands in a spacious plain, and is
quadrangular, and shows a front on every side of one hundred and
twenty stades [15 miles]; these stades make up the sum of four
hundred and eighty in the whole circumference. It was adorned
in a manner surpassing any city we are acquainted with. In the
first place, a moat deep, wide, and full of water, runs entirely round
it; next, there is a wall fifty royal cubits in breadth [about 84
feet], and in height two hundred [270 feet], but the royal cubit is
larger than the common one by three fingers' breadth. And here
I think I ought to explain how the earth, taken out of the moat,
was consumed, and in what manner the wall was built. As they
dug the moat they made bricks of the earth that was taken out;
and when they had moulded a sufficient number they baked them
in kilns. Then making use of hot asphalt for cement, and laying
wattled reeds between the thirty bottom courses of bricks, they
first built up the sides of the moat, and afterward the wall itself in
the same manner; and on the top of the wall, at the edges, they
built dwellings of one story, fronting each other, having spaces between
these dwellings wide enough to turn a chariot with four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
horses. In the circumference of the wall there were a hundred
gates, all of bronze, as also were the posts and lintels. Eight days'
journey from Babylon [200 miles] stands another city, called Is, on
a small river of the same name, which discharges its stream into
the Euphrates; this river brings down with its water many lumps
of bitumen, from which the bitumen used in the wall of Babylon
was taken. The city consists of two divisions, for the Euphrates,
separates it in the middle: this river, which is broad, deep, and
rapid, flows from Armenia, and falls into the Red Sea. The wall
on either bank has an elbow carried down to the river; and thence
along the curvatures of each bank runs a wall of baked bricks.
The city itself, which is full of houses three and four stories high,
is cut up into straight streets running at right angles to each other.
At the end of each street a little gate is formed in the wall along
the river side, in number equal to the streets; and they are all
made of bronze, and lead down to the edge of the river. This
outer wall is the chief defence, but another wall runs round within,
not much inferior to the other in strength, though narrower. In
the middle of each division of the city fortified buildings were
erected; in one, the royal palace, with a spacious and strong enclosure,
bronze-gated; and in the other, the precinct of Jupiter Belus,
which in my time was still in existence, a square building of two
stades [¼ of a mile] on every side. In the midst of this precinct is
built a solid tower of one stade both in length and breadth, and on
this tower rose another, and another upon that, to the number of
eight. And there is an ascent to these outside, running spirally
round all the towers. About the middle of the ascent there is a
landing-place and seats on which those who go up may rest themselves;
and in the uppermost tower stands a spacious temple,
handsomely furnished, and in it a large couch, with a table of
gold by its side. No statue has been erected within it, but as the
Chaldæans, who are priests of this deity, assert, though I cannot
credit what they say, the god himself comes to the temple and reclines
on the bed, in the same manner as the Egyptians say happens
at Thebes in Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
There is also another temple below, within the precinct at Babylon;
in it is a large golden statue of Jupiter seated, and near it a
great table of gold; the throne also and the step are of gold, which
together weigh eight hundred talents [twenty-two tons], as the
Chaldæans affirm. Outside the temple is a golden altar; and
another large altar, where full-grown sheep are sacrificed; for on
the golden altar only sucklings may be offered. On the great altar
the Chaldæans consume yearly a thousand talents [twenty-seven
tons] of frankincense when they celebrate the festival of this god.
There was also at that time within the precincts of this temple a
statue of solid gold, twelve cubits high [eighteen feet]; I, indeed,
did not see it, but only relate what is said by the Chaldæans. Darius,
son of Hystaspes, formed a design to take away this statue,
but dared not do so; but Xerxes, son of Darius, took it, and killed
the priest who forbade him to remove it.</p>

<p>There were many others who reigned over Babylon, whom I
shall mention in my Assyrian history, who beautified the walls and
temples, and amongst them were two women. The first of these,
named Semiramis, lived five generations before the other; she
raised mounds along the plain, which are worthy of admiration;
for before, the river used to overflow the whole plain like a sea.
But the other, who was queen next after her, and whose name was
Nitocris, (and she was much more sagacious than the other queen,)
in the first place left monuments of herself, which I shall presently
describe; and in the next place, when she saw the power of the
Medes growing formidable and restless, and that, among other
cities, Nineveh was captured by them, she took every possible precaution
for her own defence. First of all, the River Euphrates,
which before ran in a straight line, and which flows through the
middle of the city, by having channels dug above, she made so
winding, that in its course it touched three times at one and the
same village in Assyria, called Arderica: and to this day, those
who go from our sea to Babylon, if they travel by the Euphrates,
come three times to this village on three successive days. She also
raised on either bank of the river a mound, astonishing for its magnitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
and height. At a considerable distance above Babylon,
she had a reservoir for a lake dug, carrying it out some distance
from the river, and in the depth digging down to water, and in
width making its circumference of four hundred and twenty stades
[about fifty-two and a half miles]: she consumed the soil from this
excavation by heaping it up on the banks of the river, and when
it was completely dug, she had stones brought and built a casing to
it all round. She had both these works done, the river made winding,
and the whole excavation a lake, in order that the current, being
broken by frequent turnings, might be more slow, and the
navigation to Babylon tedious, and that after the voyage, a long
march round the lake might follow. All this was done in that part
of the country where the approach to Babylon is nearest, and where
is the shortest way for the Medes; in order that the Medes might
not, by holding intercourse with her people, become acquainted
with her affairs. She enclosed herself, therefore, with these defences
by digging, and immediately afterwards made the following
addition. As the city consisted of two divisions, which were separated
by the river, during the reign of former kings, when any one
had occasion to cross from one division to the other, he was obliged
to cross in a boat: and this, in my opinion, was very troublesome:
she therefore provided for this, for after she had dug the reservoir
for the lake, she left this other monument built by similar toil. She
had large blocks of stone cut, and when they were ready and the
place was completely dug out, she turned the whole stream of the
river into the place she had dug: while this was filling, and the
ancient channel had become dry, in the first place, she lined with
burnt bricks the banks of the river throughout the city, and the descents
that lead from the gates to the river, in the same manner as
the walls. In the next place, about the middle of the city, she built
a bridge with the stones she had prepared, and bound them together
with plates of lead and iron. Upon these stones she laid,
during the day, square planks of timber, on which the Babylonians
might pass over; but at night these planks were removed, to prevent
people from crossing by night and robbing one another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
When the hollow that was dug had become a lake filled by the
river, and the bridge was finished, she brought back the river to
its ancient channel from the lake.</p>

</div>

<p>The same queen also contrived the following deception. Over
the most frequented gate of the city she prepared a sepulchre for
herself, high up above the gate itself; and on the sepulchre she
had engraved, <span class="smcap">Should any one of my successors, kings of Babylon,
find himself in want of money, let him open this sepulchre,
and take as much as he chooses; but if he be not in
want, let him not open it; for that were not well.</span> This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
monument remained undisturbed, until the kingdom fell to Darius;
but it seemed hard to Darius that this gate should be of no use,
and that when money was lying there, and this money inviting
him to take it, he should not do so; but no use was made of this
gate for this reason, that a dead body was over the head of any
one who passed through it. He therefore opened the sepulchre,
and instead of money, found only the body, and these words written:
<span class="smcap">Hadst thou not been insatiably covetous, and greedy of
the most sordid gain, thou wouldest not have opened the
chambers of the dead.</span></p>

<p>Cyrus made war against the son of this queen, who bore the
name of his father Labynetus, and had the empire of Assyria.
Now when the great king leads his army in person, he carries with
him from home well prepared provisions and cattle; and he takes
with him water from the river Choaspes, which flows past Susa, of
which alone, the king drinks. A great number of four-wheeled
carriages drawn by mules carry the water of this river, after it has
been boiled in silver vessels, and follow him from place to place
wherever he marches. Cyrus, in his march against Babylon, arrived
at the river Gyndes, whose fountains are in the Matianian
mountains, and which flows through the land of the Dardanians,
and falls into another river, the Tigris; the latter, flowing by the
city of Opis, discharges itself into the Red Sea. When Cyrus
was endeavoring to cross this river Gyndes, which can be passed
only in boats, one of the sacred white horses through wantonness
plunged into the stream, and attempted to swim over, but the
stream having carried him away and drowned him, Cyrus was
much enraged with the river for this affront, and threatened to
make his stream so weak, that henceforth women should easily
cross it without wetting their knees. After this menace, deferring
his expedition against Babylon, he divided his army into two parts;
and marked out by lines one hundred and eighty channels, on
each side of the river, diverging every way; then having distributed
his army, he commanded them to dig. His design was
indeed executed by the great numbers he employed; but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
spent the whole summer in the work. When Cyrus had avenged
himself on the river Gyndes, by distributing it into three hundred
and sixty channels, and the second spring began to shine, he
then advanced against Babylon. But the Babylonians, having
taken the field, awaited his coming; and when he had advanced
near the city, the Babylonians gave battle, and, being defeated,
were shut up in the city. But as they had been long aware of the
restless spirit of Cyrus, and saw that he attacked all nations alike,
they had laid up provisions for many years; and therefore were
under no apprehensions about a siege. On the other hand, Cyrus
found himself in difficulty, since much time had elapsed, and his
affairs were not at all advanced. Whether therefore some one else
made the suggestion to him in his perplexity, or whether he himself
devised the plan, he had recourse to the following stratagem.
Having stationed the bulk of his army near the passage of the river
where it enters Babylon, and again having stationed another division
beyond the city, where the river makes its exit, he gave orders
to his forces to enter the city as soon as they should see the
stream fordable. Having thus stationed his forces, and given these
directions, he himself marched away with the ineffective part of his
army; and coming to the lake, Cyrus did the same with respect to
the river and the lake as the queen of the Babylonians had done.
For having diverted the river, by means of a canal, into the lake,
which was before a swamp, he made the ancient channel fordable
by the sinking of the river. When this took place, the Persians
who were appointed to that purpose close to the stream of the
river, which had now subsided to about the middle of a man's
thigh, entered Babylon by this passage. If, however, the Babylonians
had been aware of it beforehand, or had known what Cyrus
was about, they would not have suffered the Persians to enter the
city, but would have utterly destroyed them; for having shut all
the little gates that lead down to the river, and mounting the walls
that extend along the banks of the river, they would have caught
them as in a net; whereas the Persians came upon them by surprise.
It is related by the people who inhabited this city, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
on account of its great extent, when they who were at the extremities
were taken, those of the Babylonians who inhabited the centre
knew nothing of the capture (for it happened to be a festival)
but they were dancing at the time, and enjoying themselves, till
they received certain information of the truth. Thus was Babylon
taken for the first time.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>How great was the power of the Babylonians, I can prove by
many other circumstances, and especially by the following. The
whole territory over which the great king reigns, is divided into
districts for the purpose of furnishing subsistence for him and his
army, in addition to the usual tribute; of the twelve months in the
year, the Babylonian territory provides him with subsistence for
four, and all the rest of Asia for the remaining eight; so that the
territory of Assyria amounts to a third part of the power of all
Asia, and the government of this region, which the Persians call a
satrapy, is remunerative; since it yielded a full artabe of silver
every day to Tritæchmes son of Artabazus, who held this district
from the king: the artabe is a Persian measure, containing three
Attic chœnices more than the Attic medimnus [or about twelve
and a half gallons]. And he had a private stud of horses, in addition
to those used in war, of eight hundred stallions, and sixteen
thousand mares. He kept, too, such a number of Indian dogs, that
four considerable towns in the plain were exempted from all other
taxes and appointed to find food for the dogs. Such were the advantages
accruing to the governor of Babylon. The land of Assyria
is but little watered by rain, only enough in fact to nourish
the root of the corn; the stalk grows up, and the grain comes to
maturity only by being irrigated from the river, not, as in Egypt,
by the river overflowing the fields, but by the hand and by engines.
The Babylonian territory, like Egypt, is intersected by canals;
and the largest of these is navigable, stretching in the direction of
the winter sunrise<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>;
and it extends from the Euphrates to another
river, the Tigris, on which the city of Nineveh stood. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
is, of all lands with which we are acquainted, by far the best for
the growth of corn: but it does not carry produce trees of any
kind, either the fig, or the vine, or the olive; yet it is so fruitful
in the produce of corn, that it yields continually two hundred-fold,
and when it produces its best, it yields even three hundred-fold.
The blades of wheat and barley grow there to fully four fingers
(three inches) in breadth; and though I well know to what a height
millet and sesama grow, I shall not mention it; for I am well assured,
that to those who have never been in the Babylonian
country, what has been said concerning its productions will appear
to many incredible. They use no other oil than such as is drawn
from sesama. They have palm-trees growing all over the plain;
most of these bear fruit from which they make bread, wine, and
honey. They also tie the fruit of that which the Greeks call the
male palm, about those trees that bear dates, in order that the fly
entering the date may ripen it, lest otherwise the fruit may fall before
maturity; for the male palms have flies in the fruit, just like
wild fig-trees.</p>

<p>The most wonderful thing of all, next to the city itself, is what
I am now going to describe: their vessels that sail down the river
to Babylon are circular, and made of leather. For when they have
cut the ribs out of willows that grow in Armenia above Babylon,
they cover them with hides extended on the outside, by way of a
bottom; not making any distinction in the stern, nor contracting
the prow, but making them circular like a buckler; then having
lined this vessel throughout with reeds, they suffer it to be carried
down by the river freighted with merchandise, chiefly casks of
palm-wine. The vessel is steered by two spars, held by two men
standing upright, one of whom draws his spar in and the other
thrusts his out. Some of these vessels are made very large, and
others of a smaller size; but the largest of them carry a cargo of
five thousand talents [about one hundred and thirty-five tons].
Every vessel has a live ass on board, and the larger ones more.
For after they arrive at Babylon, and have disposed of their freight,
they sell the ribs of the boat and all the reeds by public auction;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
then having piled the skins on the asses, they return by land to
Armenia, for it is not possible by any means to sail up the river
because of the rapidity of the current: and for this reason they
make their vessels of skins and not of wood, and upon their return
to Armenia with their asses, they construct other vessels in the
same manner. For their dress, they wear a linen tunic that reaches
down to the feet; over this they put another garment of wool, and
over all a short white cloak; they have sandals peculiar to the
country, very much like the Bœotian clogs. They wear long hair,
binding their heads with turbans, and anoint the whole body with
perfumes. Every man has a seal, and a staff curiously wrought;
and on every staff is carved either an apple, a rose, a lily, an eagle,
or something of the kind; for it is not allowable to wear a stick
without a device.</p>

<p>Many curious customs prevail amongst them. This, in my
opinion, is the wisest, which I hear the Venetians, of Illyria, also
practise. Once a year, in every village, whatever maidens are of
a marriageable age, they collect together and bring in a body to
one place; around them gathers a crowd of men. Then a crier
having made them stand up one by one, offers them for sale, beginning
with the most beautiful; and when she has been sold for
a large sum, he puts up another who is next in beauty. They are
sold on condition that they shall be married. Such men among
the Babylonians as are rich and desirous of marrying, bid against
one another, and purchase the handsomest. But such of the lower
classes as are desirous of marrying, do not require a beautiful form,
but are willing to take the plainer damsels with a sum of money.
So when the crier has finished selling the handsomest of the maidens,
he makes the ugliest stand up, or one that is a cripple, and
puts her up to auction, for the person who will marry her with the
smallest sum, until she is knocked down to the man who offers to
take the least. This money is that obtained from the sale of the
handsome maidens; so that the beautiful ones portion out the ugly
and the crippled. A father is not allowed to give his daughter in
marriage to whom he pleases, nor can a purchaser carry off a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
maiden without security; but he is first obliged to give security
that he will certainly marry her, and then he may take her away.
If they do not agree, a law has been enacted that the money shall
be repaid. It is also lawful for any one who pleases to come from
another village and purchase. They have also this other custom,
second only to the former in wisdom. They bring their sick to the
market-place, for they have no physicians; then those who pass
by the sick person confer with him about the disease, to discover
whether they have themselves been afflicted with the same disease,
or have seen others so afflicted. They then advise him to have
recourse to the same treatment as that by which they escaped a
similar disease, or have known to cure others. And no one passes
by a sick person in silence, without inquiring into the nature of his
distemper. They embalm their dead in honey, and their funeral
lamentations are like those of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>There are three tribes among them that eat nothing but fish;
these, when they have taken and dried them in the sun, they treat
in the following manner: they put them into a mortar, and having
pounded them with a pestle, sift them through a fine cloth; then,
whoever pleases, kneads them into a cake, or bakes them like bread.</p>

<p>When Cyrus had conquered this nation, he was anxious to reduce
the Massagetæ to subjection. This nation is said to be both
powerful and valiant, dwelling toward the east and the rising sun
beyond the river Araxes, over against the Issedonians; there are
some who say that this nation is Scythian. The Araxes is reported
by some persons to be greater, by others less, than the Ister; they
say that there are many islands in it, some nearly equal in size to
Lesbos; and that in them are men, who during the summer feed
upon all manner of roots, which they dig out of the ground; and
that they store up for food ripe fruits which they find on the trees,
and feed upon these during the winter. They add, that they have
discovered other trees that produce fruit of a peculiar kind, which
the inhabitants, when they meet together in companies, and have
lighted a fire, throw on it, as they sit around in a circle; and that,
inhaling the fumes of the burning fruit that has been thrown on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
they become intoxicated by the odor, just as the Greeks do by
wine; and that the more fruit is thrown on, the more intoxicated
they become, until they rise up to dance and betake themselves to
singing. The river Araxes flows from the Matienian mountains,
whence also springs the river Gyndes, which Cyrus distributed
into the three hundred and sixty trenches; and it gushes out from
forty springs, all of which, except one, discharge themselves into
fens and swamps, in which it is said men live who feed on raw fish,
and clothe themselves in the skins of sea-calves; but the one stream
of the Araxes flows through an unobstructed channel into the Caspian
Sea. The Caspian is a sea by itself, having no communication
with any other sea; for the whole of that which the Greeks navigate,
and that beyond the Pillars, called the Atlantic, and the Red
Sea, are all one. But the Caspian is a separate sea of itself; being
in length a fifteen-days' voyage for a rowing boat; and in breadth,
where it is widest, an eight-days' voyage. On the western shore
of this sea stretches the Caucasus, which is in extent the largest,
and in height the loftiest, of all mountains; it contains within itself
many various nations of men, who for the most part live upon the
produce of wild fruit-trees. In this country, it is said, there are
trees which produce leaves of such a nature, that by rubbing them
and mixing them with water the people paint figures on their garments;
these figures do not wash out, but grow old with the wool,
as if they had been woven in from the first. East of the Caspian
is a plain in extent unbounded in the prospect. A great portion
of this extensive plain is inhabited by the Massagetæ, against whom
Cyrus resolved to make war; for the motives that urged and incited
him to this enterprise were many and powerful: first of all his
birth, which he thought was something more than human; and
secondly, the good fortune which had attended him in his wars;
for wherever Cyrus directed his arms, it was impossible for that
nation to escape.</p>

<p>A woman whose husband was dead, was queen of the Massagetæ;
her name was Tomyris; and Cyrus sent ambassadors under
pretence of wooing her, and made her an offer of marriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
But Tomyris, being aware that he was not wooing her, but the
kingdom of the Massagetæ, forbade their approach. Upon this Cyrus,
perceiving his artifice ineffectual, marched to the Araxes, and
openly prepared to make war on the Massagetæ, by throwing
bridges over the river, and building turrets on the boats which
carried over his army. While he was employed in this work
Tomyris sent a herald to him with this message: "King of the
Medes, desist from your great exertions; for you cannot know if
they will terminate to your advantage; and having desisted, reign
over your own dominions, and bear to see me governing what is
mine. But if you will not attend to my advice, and prefer every
thing before peace; in a word, if you are very anxious to make
trial of the Massagetæ, toil no longer in throwing a bridge over
the river; but do you cross over to our side, while we retire three
days' march from the river; or if you had rather receive us on
your side, do you the like." When Cyrus heard this proposal, he
called a council of the principal Persians, laid the matter before
them, and demanded their opinion as to what he should do: they
unanimously advised him to let Tomyris pass with her army into
his territory. But Crœsus the Lydian, who was present and disapproved
this advice, delivered a contrary opinion to that which
was put forward, and said: "O king, I assured you long ago, that
since Jupiter delivered me into your hands, I would to the utmost
of my power avert whatever misfortune I should see impending
over your house; and my own calamities,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>
sad as they are, have
been lessons to me. If you think yourself immortal, and that you
command an army that is so too, it is needless for me to make
known to you my opinion. But if you know that you too are a
man, and that you command such as are men, learn this first of all,
that there is a wheel in human affairs, which, continually revolving,
does not suffer the same persons to be always successful. My
opinion touching the matter before us is wholly at variance with
that already given. For if we shall receive the enemy into this
country, there is danger that if you are defeated, you will lose, besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
your whole empire; for it is plain that if the Massagetæ are
victorious, they will not flee home again, but will march upon your
territories: and if you are victorious, your victory is not so complete
as if, having crossed over into their territory, you should conquer
the Massagetæ and put them to flight; for then you can
march directly into the dominions of Tomyris. It is a disgrace too
that Cyrus the son of Cambyses should give way and retreat before
a woman. My opinion, therefore, is, that you should pass
over and advance as far as they retire; and then, by the following
stratagem, endeavor to get the better of them. I hear the
Massagetæ are unacquainted with the Persian luxuries, and are
unused to the comforts of life. Suppose then that you cut up and
dress an abundance of cattle, and lay out a feast in our camp for
these men; and besides, bowls of unmixed wine without stint; then
leave the weakest part of your army behind, while the rest return
again toward the river; for the Massagetæ, if I mistake not, when
they see so much excellent fare, will turn to immediately, and after
that there remains for us the display of mighty achievements."</p>

<p>Cyrus approved the suggestions of Crœsus and bade Tomyris
retire, as he would cross over to her. She accordingly retired,
as she had promised. Cyrus placed Crœsus in the hands of his
son Cambyses, to whom he also intrusted the kingdom, and
having strictly charged him to honor Crœsus, and treat him well in
case his inroad on the Massagetæ should fail, sent them back
to Persia and crossed the river with his army. When he had
passed the Araxes, and night came on, he saw a vision, as he
was sleeping in the country of the Massagetæ. He fancied that
he saw the eldest son of Hystaspes with wings on his shoulders;
and that with one of these he overshadowed Asia, and with the
other Europe. Now Darius, who was then about twenty years of
age, was the eldest son of Hystaspes, son of Arsames, one of the
Achæmenides; and he had been left in Persia, for he had not yet
attained the age of military service. When Cyrus awoke he considered
his dream with attention; and as it seemed to him of great
moment, he summoned Hystaspes, and taking him aside, said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
"Hystaspes, your son has been detected plotting against me and
my empire; and I will show you how I know it for a certainty.
The gods watch over me and forewarn me of every thing that is
about to befall me. Now, last night, as I was sleeping, I saw the
eldest of your sons with wings on his shoulders, and with one
of these he overshadowed Asia, and Europe with the other; from
this vision, it cannot be otherwise than that your son is forming
designs against me; do you therefore go back to Persia with all
speed, and take care, that when I have conquered these people
and return home, you bring your son before me to be examined."
Cyrus spoke thus under a persuasion that Darius was plotting
against him; but the deity forewarned him that he himself would die
in that very expedition, and that his kingdom would devolve on
Darius. Hystaspes, however, answered in these words: "God
forbid, O king, that a Persian should be born who would plot
against you! But if any such there be, may sudden destruction
overtake him, for you have made the Persians free instead of being
slaves, and instead of being ruled over by others to rule over all;
but if any vision informs you that my son is forming any plot
against you, I freely surrender him to you to deal with as you
please." And Hystaspes repassed the Araxes and went to Persia,
for the purpose of keeping his son Darius in custody for Cyrus.</p>

    <p>SEPULCHRAL VASES.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Cyrus having advanced one day's march from the Araxes, proceeded
to act according to the suggestion of Crœsus. After this,
when Cyrus and the effective part of the Persian army had marched
back to the Araxes, leaving the ineffective part behind, a third
division of the army of the Massagetæ attacked those of Cyrus'
forces that had been left behind, and, after some resistance, put
them to death. Then, seeing the feast laid out, as soon as they had
overcome their enemies they lay down and feasted; and being
filled with food and wine, fell asleep. Then the Persians attacked
them, and put many of them to death, and took a still greater
number prisoners, among them the son of Queen Tomyris, who
commanded the Massagetæ, and whose name was Spargapises.
When she heard what had befallen her army and her son, she sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
a herald to Cyrus with the following message: "Cyrus, insatiate
with blood, be not elated with what has now happened, that by the
fruit of the vine, with which ye yourselves, when filled with it, so
rave, that when it descends into your bodies, evil words float on
your lips; be not elated, that by such a poison you have deceived
and conquered my son, instead of by prowess in battle. But take
the good advice that I offer you. Restore my son; depart out of
this country unpunished for having insolently disgraced a third
division of the army of the Massagetæ. But if you will not do this,
I swear by the sun, the Lord of the Massagetæ, that, insatiable as
you are, I will glut you with blood." Cyrus, however, paid no attention
to this message; but Spargapises, the son of Queen
Tomyris, as soon as he recovered from the effects of the wine, and
perceived in what a plight he was, begged of Cyrus that he might
be freed from his fetters; and as soon as he was set free, and
found his hands at liberty, he put himself to death. But Tomyris,
finding Cyrus did not listen to her, assembled all her forces, and
engaged with him. I think that this battle was the most obstinate
that was ever fought between barbarians. First of all, they stood
at a distance and used their bows; afterward, when they had emptied
their quivers, they engaged in close fight with their swords and
spears, and thus they continued fighting for a long time, and
neither was willing to give way; but at length the Massagetæ got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
the better, and the greater part of the Persian army was cut in
pieces on the spot, and Cyrus himself was killed, after he had
reigned twenty-nine years. Tomyris filled a skin with human
blood, sought for the body of Cyrus among the slain of the Persians,
and thrust the head into the skin, and insulting the dead body,
said: "Thou hast indeed ruined me though alive and victorious in
battle, since thou hast taken my son by stratagem; but I will now
glut thee with blood, as I threatened." Of the many accounts given
of the end of Cyrus, this appears to me most worthy of credit.</p>

<p>The Massagetæ resemble the Scythians in their dress and mode
of living; they have both horse and foot bow-men, and javelin-men,
who are accustomed to carry battle-axes: they use gold and
bronze for every thing; for in whatever concerns spears, and
arrow-points, and battle-axes, they use bronze; but the head, and
belts, and shoulder-pieces, are ornamented with gold. In like manner
with regard to the chest of horses, they put on breastplates of
bronze; but the bridle-bit and cheek-pieces are ornamented with
gold. They make no use of silver or iron, for neither of those
metals are found in their country, but they have bronze and gold
in abundance. Their manners are as follows: when a man has
attained a great age, all his kinsmen meet, and sacrifice him, together
with cattle of several kinds; and when they have boiled the
flesh, they feast on it. This death they account the most happy;
but they do not eat the bodies of those who die of disease; but
bury them in the earth, and think it a great misfortune that they
did not reach the age to be sacrificed. They sow nothing, but live
on cattle, and fish which the river Araxes yields in abundance, and
they are drinkers of milk. They worship the sun only of all the
gods, and sacrifice horses to him; and they assign as the reason
of this custom that they think it right to offer the swiftest of all
animals to the swiftest of all the gods.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>PHYSICAL HISTORY OF EGYPT.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of Cyrus, Cambyses succeeded to the kingdom.
He was son of Cyrus, and Cassandane the daughter of Pharnaspes;
she having died some time before, Cyrus deeply mourned for her
himself, and commanded all his subjects to mourn. Cambyses
then considered the Ionians and Æolians as his hereditary slaves,
and when he made an expedition against Egypt, he took with him
some of the Greeks over whom he bore rule.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, before the reign of Psammitichus, considered
themselves to be the most ancient of mankind. But after Psammitichus
came to the throne, he endeavored to ascertain who really were
the most ancient, and from that time they have considered the
Phrygians to have been an older race than themselves. When
Psammitichus was unable, by inquiry, to discover any solution of
the question, who were the most ancient of men, he devised this
expedient. He gave two new-born children of poor parents to a
shepherd, to be brought up among his flocks, with strict orders that
no one should utter a word in their presence, that they should lie
in a solitary room by themselves, and that the shepherd should
bring goats' milk to them at certain times, and listen to discover
what word the children would first articulate, after they had given
over their insignificant mewlings. When the shepherd had pursued
this plan for the space of two years, one day as he opened the door
and went in, both the children fell upon him, and holding out their
hands, cried "Becos." At first the shepherd said nothing; but as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
this same word was repeated to him whenever he went and tended
the children, he at length acquainted his master, and by his command
brought the children into his presence. When Psammitichus
heard it he inquired what people call any thing by the name of
"Becos"; and discovered that the Phrygians call bread by that
name. So the Egyptians, convinced by the experiment, allowed
that the Phrygians were more ancient than themselves. This relation
I had from the priests of Vulcan at Memphis. But the
Greeks tell many other foolish things, among them, that Psammitichus,
having had the tongues of some women cut out, had the
children brought up by them.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were the first to discover the year, which they
divided into twelve parts, making this discovery from the stars;
and so, I think, they act more wisely than the Greeks, who insert
an intercalary month every third year, on account of the seasons;
while the Egyptians, reckoning twelve months of thirty days each,
add five days each year above that number, so that the circle of
the seasons comes round to the same point. They say also,
that the Egyptians were the first who introduced the names of the
twelve gods, and that the Greeks borrowed those names from
them; that they were the first to assign altars, images, and temples
to the gods, and to carve the figures of animals on stone. They
add that Menes was the first mortal who reigned over Egypt, and
that in his time all Egypt, except the district of Thebes, was a
morass, and that no part of the land that now exists below Lake
Myris was then above water; to this place from the sea is a seven-days'
passage up the river. It is evident to a man of common understanding,
who sees it, that the part of Egypt which the Greeks
frequent with their shipping, is land reclaimed by the Egyptians,
and a gift from the river; for when you are at the distance of a day's
sail from land, if you cast the lead you will bring up mud, yet find
yourself in eleven fathoms of water; showing the immense alluvial
deposit.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>THE TWO GREAT PYRAMIDS AT THE TIME OF THE INUNDATION.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The length of Egypt along the sea-coast is sixty schœni (450
miles) from the Plinthinetic Bay to Lake Serbonis, near which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
Mount Casius stretches. Men who are short of land measure their
territory by fathoms; those who have some possessions, by stades;
those who have much, by parasangs; and such as have a very
great extent, by schœni. A parasang is equal to thirty stades,
and each schœnus, which is an Egyptian measure, is equal to sixty
stades. So the whole coast of Egypt is three thousand six hundred
stades in length. As far as Heliopolis, inland, Egypt is wide, flat,
without water, and a swamp. The distance to Heliopolis, as one
goes up from the sea, is about equal in length to the road from
Athens&mdash;that is to say, from the altar of the twelve gods,&mdash;to Pisa
and the temple of Olympian Jupiter, or about fifteen hundred stades.
From Heliopolis upward Egypt is narrow, for on one side the
table-land of Arabia extends from north to south and southwest,
stretching up continuously to that which is called the Red Sea. In
this plateau are the stone quarries which were cut for the pyramids
at Memphis. Where its length is the greatest, I have heard that
it is a two-months' journey from east to west; and that eastward its
confines produce frankincense. On that side of Egypt which
borders upon Libya extends another rocky table-land covered with
sand, on which the pyramids stand, stretching in the same direction
as that part of the Arabian mountain that runs southward.</p>

<p>The greater part of all this country, as the priests informed me,
has been reclaimed by the Egyptians from the sea and the marshes.
For the space beyond the city of Memphis seems to me to have been
formerly a bay of the sea; as is the case also with the parts about
Ilium, Teuthrania, Ephesus, and the plain of the Mæander, if I
may be permitted to compare small things with great. There are
other rivers not equal in size to the Nile, which have wrought
great works; amongst them one of the most remarkable is the
Achelous which, flowing through Acarnania, and falling into the
sea, has already converted one half of the Echinades islands into
a continent. There is in the Arabian territory, not far from Egypt,
branching from the Red Sea, a bay of the sea of such a length
that the voyage, from the innermost part of this bay to the broad
sea, occupies forty days for a vessel with oars; but the width,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
where the bay is widest, only half a day's passage, and in it an
ebb and flow takes place daily; and I am of opinion that Egypt
was formerly a similar bay; this stretching from the Northern Sea
toward Ethiopia; and the Arabian Bay, which I am describing,
from the south toward Syria; and that they almost perforated
their recesses so as to meet each other, overlapping to some small
extent. Now, if the Nile were to turn its stream into this Arabian
gulf, what could hinder it from being filled with soil by the river
within twenty thousand years?&mdash;for my part, I think it would be filled
within ten thousand. How, then, in the time that has elapsed before
I was born, might not even a much greater bay than this have
been filled up by such a great and powerful river? I therefore
give credit to those who relate these things concerning Egypt,
when I see that Egypt projects beyond the adjoining land; that
shells are found on the mountains; that a saline humor forms on
the surface so as even to corrode the pyramids; and that this
mountain which is above Memphis is the only one in Egypt that
abounds in sand: add to which, that Egypt, in its soil, is neither
like Arabia or its confines, nor Libya, nor Syria, but is black and
crumbling, as if it were mud and alluvial deposit, brought down by
the river from Ethiopia; whereas we know that the earth of Libya
is reddish, and somewhat more sandy; and that of Arabia and
Syria is clayey and flinty.</p>

<p>The priests relate that in the reign of Mœris, when the river
rose at least eight cubits, it irrigated all Egypt below Memphis;
and yet Mœris had not been nine hundred years dead when I received
this information. But now, unless the river rises sixteen
cubits, or fifteen at least, it does not overflow the country. It appears
to me, therefore, that if the soil continues to grow in height,
in the same proportion, those Egyptians below Lake Mœris, who
inhabit other districts than that which is called Delta, must, by reason
of the Nile not overflowing their land, for ever suffer the same
calamity which they used to say the Greeks would suffer from.
For hearing that all the lands of Greece were watered by rain, and
not by rivers, as their own was, they said "that the Greeks at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
some time or other would suffer miserably from famine." But
let me state how the matter stands with the Egyptians themselves:
if, as I said before, the land below Memphis should continue to increase
in height in the same proportion as it has done in time past,
what else will happen but that the Egyptians who inhabit this part
will starve, if their land shall neither be watered by rain, nor the
river be able to inundate the fields? Now, indeed, they gather in
the fruits of the earth with less labor than any other people, for
they have not the toil of breaking up the furrows with the plough,
nor of hoeing, nor of any other work which all other men must
labor at to obtain a crop of corn; but when the river has come of
its own accord and irrigated their fields, and again subsided, then
each man sows his own land and turns swine into it; and when
the seed has been trodden in by the swine, he waits for harvest-time;
then he treads out the corn with his swine, and gathers it in.</p>

<p>All Egypt, beginning from the cataracts and the city of Elephantine,
is divided into two parts, and partakes of both names;
one belongs to Libya, and the other to Asia. The Nile, beginning
from the cataracts, flows to the sea, dividing Egypt in the middle.
Now, as far as the city of Cercasorus, the Nile flows in one stream;
but from that point it is divided into three channels. That which
runs eastward is called the Pelusiac mouth; another of the channels
bends westward, and is called the Canopic mouth; but the direct
channel of the Nile is the following: descending from above, it
comes to the point of the Delta, where it divides the Delta in the
middle, and discharges itself into the sea, supplying by this channel,
not by any means the least quantity of water, nor the least renowned;
this is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are also two other
mouths, that diverge from the Sebennytic and flow into the
sea,&mdash;the Saitic, and the Mendesian. The Bolbitine and Bucolic
mouths are not natural, but artificial. The Nile, when full, inundates
not only Delta, but also part of the country said to belong to
Libya and Arabia, to the extent of about two days' journey on
each side.</p>

<p>At the summer solstice it fills and overflows for a hundred days;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
then falls short in its stream, and retires; so that it continues low
all the winter, until the return of the summer solstice. In parts of
Ethiopia, out of which the Nile flows, the inhabitants become black
from the excessive heat; kites and swallows continue there all the
year; and the cranes, to avoid the cold of Scythia, migrate to these
parts as winter-quarters.</p>

    <p>NILE BOAT.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With respect to the sources of the Nile, no man of all the
Egyptians, Libyans, or Greeks with whom I have conversed, ever
pretended to know any thing; except the registrar of Minerva's
treasury at Sais in Egypt. But even he seemed to be trifling with
me, when he said he knew perfectly well. His account was:
"That there are two mountains rising into a sharp peak, situated
between the cities of Syene and Elephantine; the names of these
mountains are Crophi and Mophi. The sources of the Nile, which
are bottomless, flow from between these mountains, and half of
the water flows north over Egypt, and the other half to the southward
over Ethiopia. That the fountains of the Nile are bottomless,
he said, Psammitichus, king of Egypt, proved by experiment;
for he twisted a line many thousand fathoms in length and let it
down, but could not find a bottom." In my opinion, this simply
proves that there are strong whirlpools and an eddy here; so that
the water beating against the rocks, a sounding-line, when let
down, cannot reach the bottom. As you ascend the river above
the city of Elephantine, the country is so steep that it is necessary
to attach a rope on both sides of a boat as you do with an ox in a
plough, and so proceed; but if the rope should happen to break,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the boat is carried away by the force of the stream. This kind of
country lasts for a four-days' passage (or eighty miles), and the
Nile here winds as much as the Mæander. After that you come to
a level plain, where the Nile flows round an island named Tachompso.
Ethiopians inhabit the country immediately above Elephantine,
and one half of the island; the other half is inhabited by
Egyptians. Near to this island lies a vast lake, on the borders of
which Ethiopian nomads dwell; after sailing through this lake,
you come to the channel of the Nile, which flows into it: then you
have to land and travel forty days by the side of the river, for
sharp rocks rise in the Nile, and there are many sunken ones,
through which it is not possible to navigate a boat; you then must
go on board another boat, and sail for twelve days; and will at
last arrive at a large city called Meroe: this city is said to be the
capital of all Ethiopia. The inhabitants worship no other gods
than Jupiter and Bacchus; but these they honor with great magnificence;
they have also an oracle of Jupiter; and they make war,
whenever that god bids them by an oracular warning, and against
whatever country he bids them. Sailing from this city, you will
arrive at the country of the Automoli, in a space of time equal to
that which you took in coming from Elephantine to the capital of
the Ethiopians. These Automoli are called by the name of Asmak,
which in the language of Greece signifies, "those that stand at the
left hand of the king." These, to the number of two hundred and
forty thousand of the Egyptian war-tribe, once revolted to the
Ethiopians, whose king made them the following recompense.
There were certain Ethiopians disaffected toward him; he bade
them expel these, and take possession of their land; by the settlement
of these men among them, the Ethiopians became more civilized,
and learned the manners of the Egyptians.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>RELIGION, MANNERS, CUSTOMS, DRESS, AND ANIMALS OF THE EGYPTIANS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Egypt</span> possesses more wonders than any other country, and exhibits
works greater than can be described, in comparison with all
other regions; therefore more must be said about it. The Egyptians
besides having a peculiar climate and a river differing in
its nature from all other rivers, have adopted customs and usages
in almost every respect different from the rest of mankind.
Amongst them the women attend markets and traffic, but the men
stay at home and weave. Other nations, in weaving, throw
the wool upward; the Egyptians, downward. The men carry
burdens on their heads; the women, on their shoulders. No
woman can serve the office for any god or goddess; but men are
employed for both offices. Sons are not compelled to support
their parents unless they choose, but daughters are compelled
to do so, whether they choose or not. In other countries the
priests of the gods wear long hair; in Egypt they have it shaved.
With other men it is customary in mourning for the nearest relations
to have their heads shorn; the Egyptians, on occasions
of death, let the hair grow both on the head and face, though till
then shaven. Other men feed on wheat and barley, but it is
a very great disgrace for an Egyptian to make food of them; but
they make bread from spelt, which some call zea. They knead the
dough with their feet; but mix clay with their hands. Every
man wears two garments; the women, but one. Other men
fasten the rings and sheets of their sails outside; but the Egyptians,
inside. The Greeks write and cipher, moving the hand from
left to right; but the Egyptians, from right to left: and doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
so, they say they do it right-ways, and the Greeks left-ways.
They have two sorts of letters, one of which is called sacred, the
other common.</p>

<p>They are of all men the most excessively attentive to the worship
of the gods, and observe the following ceremonies: They
drink from cups of bronze, which they scour every day. They
wear linen garments, constantly fresh-washed, thinking it better to
be clean than handsome. The priests shave their whole body
every third day, that no impurity may be found upon them when
engaged in the service of the gods. The priests wear linen only,
and shoes of byblus, and are not permitted to wear any other
garments, or other shoes. They wash themselves in cold water
twice every day and twice every night, and use a great number of
ceremonies. On the other hand, they enjoy no slight advantages,
for they do not consume or expend any of their private property;
but sacred food is cooked for them, and a great quantity of beef
and geese is allowed each of them every day, with wine from the
grape; but they must not taste of fish. Beans the Egyptians do
not sow at all in their country, nor do they eat those that happen
to grow there. The priests abhor the sight of that pulse, accounting
it impure. The service of each god is performed, not by one,
but by many priests, of whom one is chief; and, when one of
them dies, his son is put in his place. The male kine they deem
sacred to Epaphus, and to that end prove them in the following
manner: If the examiner finds one black hair upon him, he
adjudges him to be unclean; one of the priests appointed for this
purpose makes this examination, both when the animal is standing
up and lying down; and he draws out the tongue, to see if it is
pure as to the prescribed marks, which I shall mention in another
part of my history. He also looks at the hairs of his tail, to see
whether they grow naturally. If the beast is found pure in all
these respects, he marks it by rolling a piece of byblus round the
horns, and then having put on it some sealing earth, he impresses
it with his signet; and so they drive him away. Any one who
sacrifices one that is unmarked is punished with death. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
established mode of sacrifice is this: they lead the victim, properly
marked, to the altar where they intend to sacrifice, and kindle a
fire; then having poured wine upon the altar, near the victim,
they invoke the god, and kill it; then cut off the head, and flay
the body of the animal. Having pronounced many imprecations
on the head, they who have a market and Greek merchants
dwelling amongst them, carry it there and sell it; but those who
have no Greeks amongst them throw it into the river; and they
pronounce the following imprecations on the head: "If any evil
is about to befall either those that now sacrifice, or Egypt in
general, may it be averted on this head." But a different mode
of disembowelling and burning the victims prevails in different
sacrifices. The practice with regard to the goddess whom they
consider the greatest, and in whose honor they celebrate the most
magnificent festival, is this: When they have flayed the bullocks,
having first offered up prayers, they take out all the intestines, and
leave the vitals with the fat in the carcass: they then cut off the
legs and the extremity of the hip, with the shoulders and neck,
and fill the body of the bullock with fine bread, honey, raisins,
figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other perfumes, and burn it, pouring
on it a great quantity of oil. They sacrifice after they have
fasted; and while the sacred things are being burnt, they all beat
themselves; after which they spread a banquet of what remains of
the victims.</p>

<p>All the Egyptians sacrifice the pure male kine and calves, but
they are not allowed to sacrifice the females, for they are sacred
to Isis; the image of Isis is made in the form of a woman with the
horns of a cow, as the Greeks represent Io; and all Egyptians
alike pay a far greater reverence to cows than to any other cattle.
No Egyptian man or woman will kiss a Greek on the mouth;
or use the knife, spit, or cauldron of a Greek, or taste of
the flesh of a pure ox that has been divided by a Greek
knife. They bury the kine that die in the following manner:
The females they throw into the river, and the males they
inter in the suburbs, with one horn, or both, appearing above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
ground, for a mark. When it is putrified, and the appointed time
arrives, a raft comes to each city from the island called Prosopitis,
in the Delta, which is nine schœni in circumference. Now in this
island Prosopitis there are several cities; but that from which the
rafts come to take away the bones of the oxen, is called Atarbechis;
in it a temple of Venus has been erected. From this city
then many persons go about to other towns; and having dug up
the bones, carry them away, and bury them in one place; and
they bury all other cattle that die in the same way that they do
the oxen; for they do not kill any of them. All those who have
a temple erected to Theban Jupiter, or belong to the Theban district,
abstain from sheep, and sacrifice goats only. For the Egyptians
do not all worship the same gods in the same manner, except
Isis and Osiris, who, they say, is Bacchus. On the other hand,
those who frequent the temple of Mendes, and belong to the Mendesian
district, abstain from goats, and sacrifice sheep. The
Thebans say that this custom was established among them in the
following way: that Hercules was very desirous of seeing Jupiter,
but Jupiter was unwilling to be seen by him; at last, however, as
Hercules persisted, Jupiter flayed a ram, cut off the head, and held
it before himself, and then having put on the fleece, showed himself
to Hercules. From this circumstance the Egyptians make
the image of Jupiter with a ram's face; and the Ammonians, who
are a colony of Egyptians and Ethiopians, and who speak a language
between both, have adopted the same practice; and, as I
conjecture, the Ammonians thus derived their name, for the Egyptians
call Jupiter, Ammon. The Thebans then do not sacrifice
rams, being for this reason accounted sacred by them; on one day
in the year, however, at the festival of Jupiter, they kill and flay
one ram, put it on this image of Jupiter, and bring an image of
Hercules to it; then all who are in the temple beat themselves in
mourning for the ram, and bury him in a sacred vault.</p>

<p>Of this Hercules I have heard that he is one of the twelve
gods; but of the other Hercules, who is known to the Greeks, I
could never hear in any part of Egypt. That the Egyptians did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
not derive the name of Hercules from the Greeks, but rather the
Greeks from the Egyptians, I have many proofs to show. The
parents of this Hercules, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of
Egyptian descent, and the Egyptians say they do not know the
names of Neptune and the Dioscuri, yet if they had derived the
name of any deity from the Greeks, they would certainly have
mentioned these above all others, since even at that time they
made voyages, and some of the Greeks were sailors. But Hercules
is one of the ancient gods of the Egyptians; and they say
themselves it was seventeen thousand years before the reign of
Amasis, when the number of their gods was increased from eight
to twelve, of whom Hercules was accounted one. Being desirous
of obtaining certain information from whatever source I could, I
sailed to Tyre in Phœnicia, having heard that there was there a
temple dedicated to Hercules; and I saw it richly adorned with a
great variety of offerings, and in it were two pillars, one of fine
gold, the other of emerald stone, both shining exceedingly at night.
Conversing with the priests of this god, I inquired how long this
temple had been built, and I found that they did not agree with
the Greeks. For they said that the temple was built at the time
when Tyre was founded, and that two thousand three hundred
years had elapsed since the foundation of Tyre. In this city I also
saw another temple dedicated to Hercules by the name of Thasian;
I went therefore to Thasos, and found there a temple of Hercules
built by the Phœnicians, who founded Thasos, when they sailed in
search of Europa, and this occurred five generations before Hercules
the son of Amphitryon appeared in Greece. The researches
then that I have made evidently prove that Hercules is a god of
great antiquity, and therefore those Greeks appear to me to have
acted most correctly, who have built two kinds of temples sacred
to Hercules, and who sacrifice to one as an immortal, under the
name of Olympian, and paid honor to the other as a hero. The
Mendesians pay reverence to all goats; at the death of a he-goat
public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
The Egyptians consider the pig to be an impure beast, and
therefore if a man in passing by a pig should touch him only with
his garments, he forthwith goes to the river and plunges in; and
in the next place, swineherds, although native Egyptians, are the
only men who are not allowed to enter any of their temples;
neither will any man give his daughter in marriage to one of them,
nor take a wife from among them; but the swineherds intermarry
among themselves. The Egyptians do not think it right to sacrifice
swine to any deities but the moon and Bacchus. In this sacrifice
of pigs to the moon, when the sacrificer has slain the victim,
he puts together the tip of the tail, with the spleen and the caul,
covers them with the fat found about the belly of the animal, and
consumes them with fire: the rest of the flesh they eat during the
full moon in which they offer the sacrifices; but on no other day
would any one even taste it. The poor amongst them, through
want of means, form pigs of dough, and having baked them, offer
them in sacrifice.</p>

<p>Whence each of the gods sprung, whether they existed always,
and of what form they were, was, so to speak, unknown till yesterday.
For I am of opinion that Hesiod and Homer lived four hundred
years before my time, and not more, and these were they who
framed a theogony for the Greeks, and gave names to the gods, and
assigned to them honors and arts, and declared their several forms.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were also the first who introduced public festivals,
processions, and solemn supplications; and the Greeks learned
these from them. The Egyptians hold public festivals several times
in a year; that which is best and most rigidly observed is in
the city of Bubastis, in honor of Diana; the second, in the city of
Busiris, is in honor of Isis; the largest temple of Isis is in this city,
in the middle of the Egyptian Delta. Isis is in the Grecian language
called Demeter. The third festival is held at Sais, in honor of
Minerva; the fourth, at Heliopolis, in honor of the sun; the fifth,
at the city of Buto, in honor of Latona; the sixth, at the city of
Papremis, in honor of Mars. When they are assembled at the
sacrifice, in the city of Sais, they all on a certain night kindle a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
great number of lamps in the open air, around their houses; the
lamps are flat vessels filled with salt and oil, the wick floats on the
surface and burns all night; hence the festival is named "the
lighting of lamps." The Egyptians who do not come to this public
assembly observe the rite of sacrifice, and all kindle lamps, not
only in Sais, but throughout all Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt, though bordering on Libya, does not abound in wild
beasts; but all that they have are accounted sacred. Superintendents,
consisting both of men and women, are appointed to feed
every kind separately; and the son succeeds the father in
this office. All the inhabitants of the cities perform their vows to
the superintendents. Having made a vow to the god to whom
the animal belongs, they shave either the whole heads of
their children, or a half, or a third part of the head, and then weigh
the hair in a scale against silver, and whatever the weight may be,
they give to the superintendent of the animals; she in return
cuts up some fish, and gives it as food to the animals; such is the
usual mode of feeding them. Should any one kill one of
these beasts, if wilfully, death is the punishment; if by accident, he
pays such fine as the priests choose to impose. But whoever kills
an ibis or a hawk, whether wilfully or by accident, must necessarily
be put to death. When a conflagration takes place, a supernatural
impulse seizes on the cats. The Egyptians, standing
at a distance, take care of the cats, and neglect to put out the fire;
but the cats often make their escape, leap over the men, and throw
themselves into the fire; when this happens great lamentations
are made among the Egyptians. In whatever house a cat
dies of a natural death, all the family shave their eyebrows; but if
a dog die, they shave the whole body and the head. All cats
that die are carried to certain sacred houses, where they are first
embalmed, and then buried in the city of Bubastis. All persons
bury their dogs in sacred vaults within their own city; and
ichneumons are buried in the same manner as the dogs; but
field-mice and hawks they carry to the city of Buto; the ibis
to Hermopolis; the bears, which are few in number, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
the wolves, which are not much larger than foxes, they bury
wherever they are found lying.</p>

    <p>THE TROCHILUS.</p>

<p>This is the nature of the crocodile:&mdash;During the four coldest
months it eats nothing, and though it has four feet, it is amphibious.
It lays its eggs on land, and there hatches them. It spends
the greater part of the day on the dry ground, but the whole
night in the river; for the water is then warmer than the air and
dew. Of all living things with which we are acquainted, this, from
the least beginning, grows to be the largest. For it lays eggs little
larger than those of a goose, and the young is at first in proportion
to the egg; but when grown up it reaches to the length of seventeen
cubits (25½ feet), and even more. It has the eyes of a
pig, large teeth, and projecting tusks: it is the only animal that
has no tongue: it does not move the lower jaw, but is the only
animal that brings down its upper jaw to the under one. It has
strong claws, and a skin covered with scales, that cannot be broken
on the back. It is blind in the water, but very quick-sighted on
land; and because it lives for the most part in the water,
its mouth is filled with leeches. All other birds and beasts
avoid him, but he is at peace with the trochilus, because he
receives benefit from that bird. For when the crocodile gets out
of the water on land, and then opens its jaws, which it does most
commonly toward the west, the trochilus enters its mouth and
swallows the leeches: the crocodile is so well pleased with this
service that it never hurts the trochilus. With some of the Egyptians
crocodiles are sacred; with others not, but they treat them as
enemies. Those who dwell about Thebes, and Lake Mœris consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
them to be very sacred; and they each of them train up a
crocodile, which is taught to be quite tame; and put crystal and
gold ear-rings into their ears, and bracelets on their fore paws;
they give them appointed and sacred food, and treat them as well
as possible while alive, and when dead they embalm them, and
bury them in sacred vaults. But the people who dwell about the
city of Elephantine eat them, not considering them sacred. They
are not called crocodiles by the Egyptians, but "champsæ"; the
Ionians gave them the name of crocodiles, because they thought
they resembled lizards, which are also so called, and which are
found in the hedges of their country. The modes of taking the
crocodile are many and various, but I shall only describe that
which seems to me most worthy of relation. When the fisherman
has baited a hook with the chine of a pig, he lets it down into the
middle of the river, and holding a young live pig on the brink of
the river, beats it; the crocodile, hearing the noise, goes in its
direction, and meeting with the chine, swallows it, and the men
draw it to land; when it is drawn out on shore, the sportsman first
of all plasters its eyes with mud, after which he manages it very
easily; but until he has done this, he has a great deal of trouble.
The hippopotamus is esteemed sacred in the district of Papremis, but
not so by the rest of the Egyptians. It is a quadruped, cloven-footed,
with the hoofs of an ox, snub-nosed, has the mane of a
horse, projecting tusks, and the tail and neigh of a horse. In size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
he is equal to a very large ox: his hide is so thick that spear-handles
are made of it when dry. Otters are also met with in the
river, which are deemed sacred; and amongst fish, they consider
that which is called the lepidotus, and the eel, sacred; these they
say are sacred to the Nile; and among birds, the vulpanser.</p>

    <p>SPEARING THE CROCODILE.</p>

<p>There is also another sacred bird, called the phœnix, which I
have never seen except in a picture; for it makes its appearance
amongst them only once in five hundred years, as the Heliopolitans
affirm: they say that it comes on the death of its sire. If he is
like the picture, he is of the following size and description: the
plumage of his wings is partly golden-colored, and partly red; in
outline and size he is like an eagle. They tell this incredible story
about him:&mdash;They say that he comes from Arabia, and brings the
body of his father, enclosed in myrrh, to the temple of the sun, and
there buries him in the temple. He brings him in this manner:
first he moulds an egg of myrrh as large as he thinks himself able
to carry; then he tries to carry it, and when he has made the experiment,
he hollows out the egg, puts his parent into it, and stops
up with some more myrrh the hole through which he introduced the
body, so when his father is put inside, the weight is the same as
before; then he carries him to the temple of the sun in Egypt.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Thebes there are sacred serpents not at
all hurtful to men: they are diminutive in size, and carry two
horns that grow on the top of the head. When these serpents die
they bury them in the temple of Jupiter, for they say they are
sacred to that God. There is a place in Arabia, situated very near
the city of Buto, to which I went, on hearing of some winged serpents;
there I saw bones and spines of serpents in such quantities
as it would be impossible to describe: there were heaps upon
heaps, some large, some smaller, scattered in a narrow pass between
two mountains, which leads into a spacious plain, contiguous
to the plain of Egypt: it is reported that at the beginning of spring,
winged serpents fly from Arabia toward Egypt; but that ibises, a
sort of bird, meet them at the pass, and do not allow the serpents
to go by, but kill them: for this service the Arabians say that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
ibis is highly reverenced by the Egyptians; and the Egyptians
acknowledge it. The ibis is all over a deep black; it has the legs
of a crane, its beak is much curved, and it is about the size of the
crex. Such is the form of the black ones, that fight with the serpents.
But those that are best known, for there are two species,
are bare on the head and the whole neck, have white plumage,
except on the head, the throat, and the tips of the wings and extremity
of the tail; in all these parts they are of a deep black; in
their legs and beak they are like the other kind. The form of the
serpent is like that of the water-snake; but he has wings without
feathers, and as like as possible to the wings of a bat. This must
suffice for the description of sacred animals.</p>

<p>Of the Egyptians, those who inhabit that part of Egypt which
is sown with corn, cultivate the memory of past events more than
any other people, and are the best-informed men I ever met.
Their manner of life is this: They purge themselves every month
for three days successively, seeking to preserve health by emetics
and clysters, for they suppose that all diseases to which men are
subject proceed from the food they use. And indeed in other
respects the Egyptians, next to the Libyans, are the most healthy
people in the world, as I think, on account of the seasons, because
they are not liable to change; for men are most subject to disease
at periods of change, and above all others at the change of the
seasons. They feed on bread made into loaves of spelt, which
they call cyllestis; and they use wine made of barley, for they
have no vines in that country. Some fish they dry in the sun and
eat raw, others salted with brine; and of birds they eat quail,
ducks, and smaller birds raw, salting them first. All other things,
whether birds or fishes, that they have, except such as are accounted
sacred, they eat either roasted or boiled. At their convivial banquets,
among the wealthy classes, when they have finished supper,
a man carries round in a coffin the image of a dead body carved
in wood, made as perfect a counterfeit as possible in color and
workmanship, and in size generally about one or two cubits in
length; and showing this to each of the company, he says: "Look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
upon this, then drink and enjoy yourself; for when dead you will
be like this."</p>

<p>They observe their ancient customs and acquire no new ones.
Among other memorable customs they have just one song called
"Linus," which is sung in Phœnicia, Cyprus, and elsewhere; in
different nations it bears a different name, but it agrees almost
exactly with the same which the Greeks sing, under the name of
Linus. So that among the many wonderful things in Egypt, the
greatest wonder of all is where they got this Linus; for they
seem to have sung it from time immemorial. The "Linus" in the
Egyptian language is called Maneros; and the Egyptians say that
he was the only son of the first king of Egypt, and that happening
to die prematurely, he was honored by the Egyptians in this mourning
dirge, the first and only song they have. In the following particular
the Egyptians resemble the Lacedæmonians only among all
the Greeks: the young men, when they meet their elders, give
way and turn aside; and rise from their seats when they approach.
But, unlike any nation of the Greeks, instead of addressing
one another in the streets, they salute by letting the hand fall down
as far as the knee. They wear linen tunics fringed round the legs,
which they call calasiris, and over these they throw white woollen
mantles; woollen clothes, however, are not carried into the temples,
nor are they buried with them, as this is accounted profane&mdash;agreeing
in this respect with the worshippers of Orpheus and Bacchus,
who are Egyptians and Pythagoreans: for they consider it
profane for one who is initiated in these mysteries to be buried in
woollen garments for some religious reason or other. The Egyptians
have discovered more prodigies than all the rest of the world.
They have amongst them oracles of Hercules, Apollo, Minerva,
Diana, Mars, and Jupiter; but that which they honor above all
others is the oracle of Latona in the city of Buto. The art of medicine
is divided amongst them into specialties, each physician
applying himself to one disease only. All places abound in physicians,
some for the eyes, others for the head, others for the teeth,
others for cutaneous diseases, and others still for internal disorders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
Their manner of mourning and burying is as follows: When a
man of any consideration dies, all the women of that family besmear
their heads and faces with mud, leave the body in the house,
and wander about the city, beating themselves, having their clothes
girt up, their neck and breast exposed, and all their relations
accompany them. The men, too, beat themselves in the same way.
When they have done this, they carry out the body to be embalmed.
There are persons who are specially appointed for this purpose;
when the dead body is brought to them, they show to the bearers
wooden models of corpses, skilfully painted to illustrate the various
methods of embalming. They first show the most expensive manner
of embalming; then the second, which is inferior and less expensive;
and lastly, the third and cheapest. The relations stipulate
which style they prefer, agree on the price, and depart. To
embalm a body in the most expensive manner, they first draw out
the brains through the nostrils with an iron hook, perfecting the
operation by the infusion of drugs. Then with a sharp Ethiopian
stone they make an incision in the side, and take out all the
bowels; and having cleansed the abdomen and rinsed it with palm-wine,
they next sprinkle it with pounded perfumes. Then they
fill the belly with pure myrrh pounded, and cassia, and other perfumes,
frankincense excepted, and sew it up again; this done, they
steep it in natrum, leaving it under for seventy days; a longer
time than which it is not lawful to steep it. At the expiration of the
seventy days they wash the corpse, and wrap the whole body in
bandages of flaxen cloth, smearing it with gum, which the Egyptians
commonly use instead of glue. After this the relations take
the body back again, make a wooden case in the shape of a man,
enclose the body in it, and store it in a sepulchral chamber, setting
it upright against the wall. For those who, to avoid great expense,
desire the middle way, they prepare in the following manner.
Charging syringes with oil made from cedar, they fill the abdomen
of the corpse without making any incision or taking out the bowels,
but inject it at the fundament; and having prevented the injection
from escaping, they steep the body in natrum for the prescribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
number of days, on the last of which they let out from the abdomen
the oil of cedar which has such power that it brings away the intestines
and vitals in a state of dissolution; the natrum dissolves
the flesh, and nothing of the body remains but the skin and the
bones. The operation is then complete. The third method of
embalming, which is used only for the poorer sort, consists in
thoroughly rinsing the abdomen in syrmæa, and steeping it with
natrum for the seventy days. Should any person, whether Egyptian
or stranger, be found to have been seized by a crocodile, or
drowned in the river, to whatever city the body may be carried,
the inhabitants are by law compelled to have the body embalmed,
and adorned in the handsomest manner, and buried in the sacred
vaults. Nor is it lawful for any one else, whether relations or
friends, to touch him; but the priests of the Nile bury the corpse
with their own hands, as being something more than human.</p>

<p>They avoid using Grecian customs; and, in a word, the customs
of all other people whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Egyptians who dwell in the morasses, have the same
customs as the rest of the Egyptians, and each man has
but one wife, like the Greeks. But to obtain food more
easily, they have the following inventions: when the river is
full, and has made the plains like a sea, great numbers of lilies,
which the Egyptians call lotus, spring up in the water: these they
gather and dry in the sun; then having pounded the middle of
the lotus, which resembles a poppy, they make bread of it and
bake it. The root also of this lotus is fit for food, and is tolerably
sweet; it is round, and of the size of an apple. There are also
other lilies, like roses, that grow in the river, the fruit of which is
contained in a separate pod, that springs up from the root in form
very much like a wasp's nest; in this there are many berries fit to
be eaten, of the size of an olive stone, and they are eaten both fresh
and dried. The byblus, an annual plant, is found in the fens. They
cut off the top and put it to some other uses, but the lower part
that is left, to the length of a cubit, they eat and sell. Those who
are anxious to eat the byblus dressed in the most delicate manner,
stew it in a hot pan and then eat it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
The Egyptians who live about the fens use an oil drawn from
the fruit of the sillicypria, which they call cici: they plant and cultivate
these sillicypria, which in Greece grow spontaneous and
wild, on the banks of the rivers and lakes: under cultivation these
bear an abundance of fruit, though of an offensive smell. Some
bruise it and press out the oil; others boil and stew it, and collect
the liquid that flows from it; this is fat, and no less suited for lamps
than olive oil; but it emits a disgusting smell. They contrive in
various ways to protect themselves from the mosquitoes, which
are very abundant. Towers are of great service to those who inhabit
the upper parts of the marshes; for the mosquitoes are prevented
by the winds from flying high: but those who live round
the marshes have contrived another expedient. Every man has a
net, with which in the daytime he takes fish, and at night, in whatever
bed he sleeps, he throws the net around it, and crawls in underneath;
if he should wrap himself up in his clothes or in linen,
the mosquitoes would bite through them, but they never attempt
to bite through the net.</p>

<p>Their ships in which they convey merchandise are made of the
acacia, which in shape is much like the Cyrenæan lotus, and exudes
a gum. From this acacia they cut planks about two cubits in
length and join them together like bricks, building their ships in
the following manner: They fasten the planks of two cubits
length round stout and long ties: when they have thus built the
hulls, they lay benches across them. They make no use of ribs,
but caulk the seams inside with byblus. They make only one
rudder, and that is driven through the keel. They use a mast of
acacia, and sails of byblus. These vessels are unable to sail up
the stream unless a fair wind prevails, but are towed from the
shore. They are thus carried down the stream: there is a hurdle
made of tamarisk, wattled with a band of reeds, and a stone with a
hole in the middle, of about two talents in weight; of these two,
the hurdle is fastened to a cable, and let down at the prow of the
vessel to be carried on by the stream; and the stone by another
cable at the stern; and by this means the hurdle, by the stream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
bearing hard upon it, moves quickly and draws along "the baris"
(for this is the name given to these vessels), but the stone being
dragged at the stern, and sunk to the bottom, keeps the vessel in its
course. They have very many of these vessels, and some of them
carry many thousand talents. When the Nile inundates the
country, the cities alone are seen above its surface, like the islands
dotting the Ægean Sea. When this happens, they navigate no
longer by the channel of the river, but straight across the country.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>GOD-KINGS PRIOR TO MENES.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> former time, the priests of Jupiter did to Hecatæus the historian,
when he was tracing his own genealogy, and connecting his
family with a god in the sixteenth degree, the same as they did to
me, though I did not endeavor to trace my genealogy. Conducting
me into the interior of a spacious edifice, and showing me
four hundred and forty-five wooden colossuses, they counted
them over; for every high-priest places an image of himself there
during his lifetime; the priests pointed out that the succession from
father to son was unbroken. But when Hecatæus traced his own
genealogy, and connected himself with a god in the sixteenth degree,
they controverted his genealogy by computation, not admitting
that a man could be born from a god; and said that each
of the colossuses was a Piromis, sprung from a Piromis; until
they pointed out the three hundred and forty-five colossuses,
each a Piromis, sprung from a Piromis, and they did not connect
them with any god or hero. Piromis means, in the
Grecian language, "a noble and good man." They said that these
were very far from being gods; but before the time of these men,
gods had been the rulers of Egypt, and had dwelt amongst men;
and that one of them always had the supreme power, and that
Orus, the son of Osiris, was the last who reigned over it. Now,
Osiris in the Greek language means Bacchus, and Orus is the
equivalent of Apollo.</p>

<p>All the revenue from the city of Anthylla, which is of much importance,
is assigned to purchase shoes for the wife of the reigning
king of Egypt.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>FIRST LINE OF 330 KINGS, ONLY THREE MENTIONED.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> priests informed me, that Menes, who first ruled over
Egypt, in the first place protected Memphis by a mound; for the
whole river formerly ran close to the sandy mountain on the side
of Libya; but Menes, beginning about a hundred stades above
Memphis, filled in the elbow toward the south, dried up the old
channel, and conducted the river into a canal, so as to make it flow
between the mountains. This bend of the Nile is still carefully
upheld by the Persians, and made secure every year; for if the
river should break through and overflow in this part, there would
be danger lest all Memphis should be flooded. When the part cut
off had been made firm land by this Menes, who was first king, he
built on it the city that is now called Memphis; and outside of it
he excavated a lake from the river toward the north and the west;
for the Nile itself bounds it toward the east. In the next place,
they relate that he built in it the temple of Vulcan, which is vast
and well worthy of mention. After this the priests enumerated
from a book the names of three hundred and thirty other kings. In
so many generations of men, there were eighteen Ethiopians and
one native queen, the rest were Egyptians. The name of this
woman who reigned, was the same as that of the Babylonian queen,
Nitocris: they said that she avenged her brother, whom the
Egyptians had slain, while reigning over them. After they had
slain him, they delivered the kingdom to her; and she, to avenge
him, destroyed many of the Egyptians by this stratagem: she
caused an extensive apartment to be made underground, and pretended
that she was going to consecrate it, then inviting those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
the Egyptians whom she knew to have been principally concerned
in the murder, she gave them a great banquet, and in the midst of
the feast let in the river upon them, through a large concealed
channel. Of the other kings they did not say that they were in any
respect renowned, except the last, Mœris; he accomplished some
memorable works, as the portal of Vulcan's temple, facing the
north wind; and dug a lake, and built pyramids in it, the size of
which I shall mention when I come to speak of the lake itself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>FROM SESOSTRIS TO SETHON.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I shall</span> next mention king Sesostris. The priests said
that he was the first who, setting out in ships of war from the
Arabian Gulf, subdued those nations that dwell by the Red Sea.</p>

<p>There are also in Ionia two images of this king, carved on
rocks, one on the way from Ephesia to Phocæa, the other from
Sardis to Smyrna. In both places a man is carved, four cubits
and a half high, holding a spear in his right hand, and a bow in
his left, and the rest of his equipment in unison, for it is partly
Egyptian and partly Ethiopian; from one shoulder to the other
across the breast extend sacred Egyptian characters engraved,
which have the following meaning: "<span class="smcap">I acquired this region by
my own shoulders.</span>"</p>

<p>The priests tell a yarn of this Egyptian Sesostris, that returning
and bringing with him many men from the nations whose territories
he had subdued, when he arrived at the Pelusian Daphnæ,
his brother, to whom he had committed the government of Egypt,
invited him to an entertainment, and his sons with him, and caused
wood to be piled up round the house and set on fire: but that
Sesostris, being informed of this, immediately consulted with his
wife, for he had taken his wife with him; she advised him to extend
two of his six sons across the fire, and form a bridge over the
burning mass, and that the rest should step on them and make
their escape. Sesostris did so, and two of his sons were in this
manner burned to death, but the rest, together with their father,
were saved. Sesostris having returned to Egypt, and taken revenge
on his brother, employed the multitude of prisoners whom
he brought from the countries he had subdued in many remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
works: these were the men who drew the huge stones which,
in the time of this king, were conveyed to the temple of Vulcan;
they, too, were compelled to dig all the canals now seen in Egypt;
and thus by their involuntary labor made Egypt, which before was
throughout practicable for horses and carriages, unfit for these purposes.
But the king intersected the country with this network of
canals for the reason that such of the Egyptians as occupied the
inland cities, being in want of water when the river receded, were
forced to use a brackish beverage unfit to drink, which they drew
from wells. They said also that this king divided the country
amongst all the Egyptians, giving an equal square allotment to
each; and thence drew his revenues by requiring them to pay a
fixed tax every year; if the river happened to take away a part of
any one's allotment, he was to come to him and make known what
had happened; whereupon the king sent persons to inspect and
measure how much the land was diminished, that in future he
might pay a proportionate part of the appointed tax. Land-measuring
appears to me to have had its beginning from this act,
and to have passed over into Greece; for the pole <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
and the sundial,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
and the division of the day into twelve parts, the Greeks
learned from the Babylonians. This king was the only Egyptian
that ever ruled over Ethiopia; he left as memorials in front of
Vulcan's temple statues of stone: two of thirty cubits, of himself
and his wife; and four, each of twenty cubits, of his sons. A long
time after, the priest of Vulcan would not suffer Darius the Persian
to place his statue before them, saying, "that deeds had not been
achieved by him equal to those of Sesostris the Egyptian: for
Sesostris had subdued other nations, not fewer than Darius had
done, and the Scythians besides; but that Darius was not able to
conquer the Scythians; wherefore it was not right for one who
had not surpassed him in achievements to place his statue before
his offerings." They relate, however, that Darius pardoned these
observations.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>After the death of Sesostris, his son Pheron succeeded to the
kingdom; he undertook no military expedition, and happened to
become blind through the following occurrence: the river having
risen to a very great height for that time, eighteen cubits, it overflowed
the fields, a storm of wind arose, and the river was tossed
about in waves; whereupon they say that the king with great arrogance
laid hold of a javelin, and threw it into the midst of the eddies
of the river; and that immediately afterward he was seized
with a pain in his eyes, and became blind. He continued blind for
ten years; but in the eleventh, having escaped from this calamity,
he dedicated offerings throughout all the celebrated temples, the
most worthy of mention being two stone obelisks to the temple of
the sun, each consisting of a single block of granite, and each a
hundred cubits in length and eight cubits in breadth.</p>

<p>A native of Memphis succeeded him in the kingdom, whose
name in the Grecian language is Proteus; there is to this day an
enclosure sacred to him at Memphis, which is very beautiful and
richly adorned, situated to the south side of the temple of Vulcan.
The priests told me that when Paris had carried Helen off from
Sparta, violent winds drove him out of his course in the Ægean
into the Egyptian Sea, and from there (for the gale did not abate)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
he came to Egypt, and in Egypt to that which is now called the
Canopic mouth of the Nile.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>PARIS CARRYING AWAY HELEN.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And Homer appears to me to have heard this relation; but as
it was not so well suited to epic poetry as the other which he has
made use of, he rejected it. He has told in the Iliad the wanderings
of Paris; how, while he was carrying off Helen, he was driven
out of his course, and wandered to other places, and how he arrived
at Sidon of Phœnicia; and in the exploits of Diomede, his verses
are as follows: "Where were the variegated robes, works of Sidonian
women, which god-like Paris himself brought from Sidon,
sailing over the wide sea, along the course by which he conveyed
high-born Helen."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>
He mentions it also in the Odyssey, in the
following lines: "Such well-chosen drugs had the daughter of Jove,
of excellent quality, which Polydamna gave her, the Egyptian wife
of Thonis, where the fruitful earth produces many drugs, many excellent
when mixed, and many noxious."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
Menelaus also says the following to Telemachus: "The gods detained me in Egypt, though
anxious to return hither, because I did not offer perfect hecatombs
to them."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
He shows in these verses, that he was acquainted with
the wandering of Paris in Egypt; for Syria borders on Egypt, and
the Phœnicians, to whom Sidon belongs, inhabit Syria. From
these verses, and this first passage especially, it is clear that Homer
was not the author of the Cyprian verses, but some other person.
For in the Cyprian verses it is said, that Paris reached Ilium from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
Sparta on the third day, when he carried off Helen, having met
with a favorable wind and a smooth sea; whereas Homer in the
Iliad says that he wandered far while taking her with him.</p>

<p>Rhampsinitus succeeded Proteus in the kingdom: He left as
a monument the portico of the temple of Vulcan, fronting to the
west; and erected two statues before the portico, twenty-five
cubits high. Of these, the one standing to the north the Egyptians
call Summer; and that to the south, Winter: and the one
that they call Summer, they worship and do honor to; but the one
called Winter, they treat in a quite contrary way.</p>

<p>This king, they said, possessed a great quantity of money, such
as no one of the succeeding kings was able to attain. Wishing to
treasure up his wealth in safety, he built a chamber of stone, one of
the walls of which adjoined the outside of the palace. But the builder,
forming a plan against it, devised the following contrivance; he
fitted one of the stones so that it might be easily taken out by two
men, or even one. When the chamber was finished, the king laid
up his treasures in it; in the course of time the builder, finding his
end approaching, called his two sons to him, and described to them
how he had provided when he was building the king's treasury
that they might have abundant sustenance; and having clearly
explained to them every thing relating to the removal of the stone,
he gave them its dimensions, and told them, if they would observe
his instructions, they would be stewards of the king's riches. He
died, and the sons were not long in applying themselves to the
work; coming by night to the palace, they found the stone in the
building, easily removed it, and carried off a great quantity of
treasure. When the king happened to open the chamber, he was
astonished at seeing the vessels deficient in treasure; but was not
able to accuse any one, as the seals were unbroken, and the
chamber well secured. When on opening it two or three times,
the treasures were always evidently diminished (for the thieves
did not cease plundering), he adopted the following plan: he
ordered traps to be made, and placed them round the vessels in
which the treasures were. But when the thieves came as before,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
and one of them had entered, as soon as he went near a vessel, he
was straightway caught in the trap; perceiving, therefore, in what a
predicament he was, he immediately called to his brother, and told
him what had happened, and bade him enter as quick as possible,
and cut off his head, lest, if he was seen and recognized, he should
ruin him also: the other thought that he spoke well, and did as he
was advised; then, having fitted in the stone, he returned home,
taking with him his brother's head. When day came, the king
entered the chamber, and was astonished at seeing the body of the
thief in the trap without the head, but the chamber secure, and
without any means of entrance or exit. In this perplexity he contrived
another plan: he hung up the body of the thief on a public
wall, and having placed sentinels there, ordered them to seize and
bring before him whomsoever they should see weeping or expressing
commiseration at the spectacle. The mother was greatly
grieved at the body being suspended, and coming to words with her
surviving son, commanded him, by any means he could, to contrive
how he might take down and bring away the corpse of his
brother; and if he should neglect to do so, she threatened to go
to the king, and inform him that he had the treasures. Having
got some asses, and filled some skins with wine, he put them on
the asses, and then drove them along; but when he came near
the sentinels that guarded the suspended corpse, he drew out two
or three of the necks of the skins that hung down, and loosened
them; and, as the wine ran out, he beat his head, and cried out
aloud, as if he knew not to which of the asses he should turn first.
The sentinels, when they saw wine flowing in abundance, ran into
the road, with vessels in their hands, caught the wine that was
being spilt, thinking it all their own gain; but the man, feigning
anger, railed bitterly against them all; however, as the sentinels
soothed him, he at length pretended to be pacified; and at last
drove his asses out of the road, and set them to rights again.
When more conversation passed, and one of the sentinels joked
with him and set him laughing, he gave them another of the skins;
and they, just as they were, lay down and set to to drink, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
invited him to stay and drink with them. He was persuaded, and
remained with them; and as they treated him kindly during the
drinking, he gave them another of the skins; and the sentinels,
having taken very copious draughts, became royally drunk, and,
overpowered by the wine, fell asleep on the spot. Then he took
down the body of his brother, and having by way of insult shaved
the right cheeks of all the sentinels, laid the corpse on the asses,
and drove home, having performed his mother's injunctions.
The king, upon being informed that the body of the thief had been
stolen, was exceedingly indignant, but being unable by any means
to find out the contriver of this artifice, he grew so astonished at
the shrewdness and daring of the man, that at last, sending
throughout all the cities, he caused a proclamation to be made,
offering a free pardon, and promising great reward to the man, if
he would discover himself. The thief, relying on this promise,
went to the king's palace; and Rhampsinitus greatly admired him,
and gave him his daughter in marriage, accounting him the most
knowing of all men; for while the Egyptians were superior to all
others, he was superior to the Egyptians.</p>

<p>After this, they said that this king descended alive into the
place which the Greeks call Hades, and there played at dice with
Ceres, and sometimes won, and other times lost; and that he
came up again and brought with him as a present from her a
napkin of gold. Any person to whom such things appear credible
may adopt the accounts given by the Egyptians; it is my object,
however, throughout the whole history, to write what I hear from
each people. The Egyptians say that Ceres and Bacchus hold the
chief sway in the infernal regions; and the Egyptians were also the
first who asserted the doctrine that the soul of man is immortal,
and that when the body perishes the soul enters into some other
animal, constantly springing into existence; and when it has
passed through the different kinds of terrestrial, marine, and aërial
beings, it again enters into the body of a man that is born; and
that this revolution is made in three thousand years.</p>

    <p>BES AND HI.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, they told me that down to the reign of Rhampsinitus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
there was a perfect distribution of justice, and that all Egypt was
in a high state of prosperity; but that after him Cheops, coming to
reign over them, plunged into every kind of wickedness. For,
having shut up all the temples, he first of all forbade them to offer
sacrifice, and afterward ordered all the Egyptians to work for him;
some, accordingly, were appointed to draw stones from the quarries
in the Arabian mountain down to the Nile, others he ordered
to receive the stones when transported in vessels across the river,
and to drag them to the mountain called the Libyan. And they
worked to the number of a hundred thousand men at a time, each
party during three months. The time during which the people
were thus harassed by toil lasted ten years on the road which they
constructed, along which they drew the stones, a work, in my
opinion, not much less than the pyramid: for its length is five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
stades, and its width ten orgyæ, and its height, where it is the
highest, eight orgyæ; and it is of polished stone, with figures
carved on it: ten years, then, were expended on this road, and in
forming the subterraneous apartments on the hill, on which the
pyramids stand, which he had made as a burial vault for himself,
in an island, formed by draining a canal from the Nile. Twenty
years were spent in erecting the pyramid itself: of this, which is
square, each face is eight plethra, and the height is the same; it is
composed of polished stones, and joined with the greatest exactness;
none of the stones are less than thirty feet in length. This
pyramid was built in the form of steps, which some call crosssæ,
others bomides. When they had first built it in this manner, they
raised the stones for covering the surface by machines made of
short pieces of wood: having lifted them from the ground to the
first range of steps, when the stone arrived there it was put on
another machine that stood ready on the first range; from this it
was drawn to the second range on another machine; for the
machines were equal in number to the ranges of steps; or they
removed the machine, which was only one, and portable, to each
range in succession, whenever they wished to raise the stone
higher; for I should relate it in both ways, as it was related to me.
The highest parts of it were first finished, and last of all the parts on
the ground. On the pyramid is shown an inscription, in Egyptian
characters, how much was expended in radishes, onions, and garlic
for the workmen; which the interpreter, as I well remember, reading
the inscription, told me amounted to one thousand six hundred
talents of silver. If this be really the case, how much more was
probably expended in iron tools, in bread, and in clothes for the
laborers, since they occupied in building the works the time which
I mentioned, and no short time besides, as I think, in cutting and
drawing the stones, and in forming the subterraneous excavation.
It is related that Cheops in his cruelty subjected his daughter to
every sort of disgrace, but she contrived to leave a monument of
herself, and asked every one that she met to give her a stone
toward the edifice she designed: of these stones they said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
pyramid was built that stands in the middle of the three, before the
great pyramid, each side of which is a plethron and a half in length.
The Egyptians say that this Cheops reigned fifty years; and when
he died, his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom; and he
followed the same practices as the other, both in other respects,
and in building a pyramid. This does not come up to the dimensions
of his brother's, for I myself measured them; nor has it subterraneous
chambers; nor does a channel from the Nile flow to it,
as to the other; but this flows through an artificial aqueduct round
an island within, in which they say the body of Cheops is laid.
Having laid the first course of variegated Ethiopian stones, less in
height than the other by forty feet, he built it near the large pyramid.
They both stand on the same hill, which is about a hundred
feet high. Chephren, they said, reigned fifty-six years. Thus one
hundred and six years are reckoned, during which the Egyptians
suffered all kinds of calamities, and for this length of time the temples
were never opened. From the hatred they bear them the
Egyptians are not very willing to mention their names; but call
the pyramids after Philition, a shepherd, who at that time kept his
cattle in those parts.</p>

<p>They said that after him, Mycerinus, son of Cheops, reigned
over Egypt; that the conduct of his father was displeasing to him;
and that he opened the temples, and permitted the people, who
were worn down to the last extremity, to return to their employments,
and to sacrifices; and that he made the most just decisions
of all their kings. On this account, of all the kings that ever reigned
in Egypt, they praise him most, for he both judged well in other
respects, and moreover, when any man complained of his decision,
he used to make him some present out of his own treasury and
pacify his anger. To this beneficent Mycerinus, the beginning of
misfortunes was the death of his daughter, who was his only child;
whereupon he, extremely afflicted, and wishing to bury her in a
more costly manner than usual, caused a hollow wooden image of
a cow to be made and covered with gold, into which he put the
body of his deceased daughter. This cow was not interred in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
ground, but even in my time was exposed to view in the city of
Sais, placed in the royal palace, in a richly furnished chamber.
They burn near it all kinds of aromatics every day, and a lamp is
kept burning by it throughout each night.</p>

<p>The cow is covered with a purple cloth, except the head and
the neck, which are overlaid with very thick gold; and the orb of
the sun imitated in gold is placed between the horns. The cow is
kneeling; in size equal to a large, living cow.</p>

<p>After the loss of his daughter, a second calamity befell this king:
an oracle reached him from the city of Buto, importing, "that he
had no more than six years to live, and should die in the seventh."
Thinking this very hard, he sent a reproachful message to the god,
complaining, "that his father and uncle, who had shut up the
temples, and paid no regard to the gods, and moreover had
oppressed men, had lived long; whereas he who was religious
must die so soon." But a second message came to him from the
oracle, stating, "that for this very reason his life was shortened,
because he had not done what he ought to have done; for it was
needful that Egypt should be afflicted during one hundred and fifty
years; and the two who were kings before him understood this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
but he did not." When Mycerinus heard this, and saw that this
sentence was now pronounced against him, he ordered a great
number of lamps to be made, which were lighted whenever night
came on, and he drank and enjoyed himself, never ceasing night
or day, roving about the marshes and groves, wherever he could
hear of places most suited for pleasure. He had recourse to this
artifice for the purpose of convicting the oracle of falsehood, that
by turning the nights into days, he might have twelve years instead
of six.</p>

<p>This king also left a pyramid, but much smaller than that of his
father, being on each side twenty feet short of three plethra; it is
quadrangular, and built half way up of Ethiopian stone.</p>

<p>After Mycerinus, the priests said, that Asychis became king of
Egypt, and that he built the eastern portico to the temple of Vulcan,
which is by far the largest and most beautiful in its wealth of
sculptured figures and infinite variety of architecture. This king,
being desirous of surpassing his predecessors, left a pyramid, as a
memorial, made of bricks; on which is an inscription carved on
stone, in the following words: "Do not despise me in comparison
with the pyramids of stone, for I excel them as much as Jupiter, the
other gods. For by plunging a pole into a lake, and collecting
the mire that stuck to the pole, men made bricks, and in this manner
built me."</p>

<p>After him there reigned a blind man of the city of Anysis, whose
name was Anysis. During his reign, the Ethiopians and their king,
Sabacon, invaded Egypt with a large force; whereupon this blind
king fled to the fens; and the Ethiopian reigned over Egypt for fifty
years, during which time he performed the following actions: When
any Egyptians committed any crime, he would not have any of them
put to death, but passed sentence upon each according to the magnitude
of his offence, enjoining them to heap up mounds of earth,
each offender against his own city, and by this means the cities
were made much higher; for first of all they had been raised
considerably by those who dug the canals in the time of king
Sesostris. Although other cities in Egypt were carried to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
great height, in my opinion the greatest mounds were thrown
up about the city of Bubastis, in which is a beautiful temple of
Bubastis corresponding to the Grecian Diana. Her sacred precinct
is thus situated: all except the entrance is an island; for two
canals from the Nile extend to it, not mingling with each other,
but each reaches as far as the entrance to the precinct, one flowing
round it on one side, the other on the other. Each is a hundred
feet broad, and shaded with trees. The portico is ten orgyæ in
height, and is adorned with figures six cubits high, that are deserving
of notice. This precinct, being in the middle of the city, is
visible on every side to a person going round it; for while the
city has been mounded up to a considerable height, the temple has
not been moved, so that it is conspicuous as it was originally
built. A wall sculptured with figures runs round it; and within is
a grove of lofty trees, planted round a large temple in which the
image is placed. The width and length of the precinct is each
way a stade. Along the entrance is a road paved with stone,
four plethra in width and about three stades in length, leading
through the square eastward toward the temple of Mercury;
on each side of the road grow trees of enormous height. They
told me that the final departure of the Ethiopian occurred in
the following manner: it appeared to him in a vision that a man,
standing by him, advised him to assemble all the priests in Egypt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
and to cut them in two down the middle; but he, fearing that the
gods held out this as a pretext to him, in order that he, having
been guilty of impiety in reference to sacred things, might draw
down some evil on himself from gods or from men, would not do
so; but as the time had expired during which it was foretold that
he should reign over Egypt, he departed hastily from the country.
When Sabacon of his own accord had departed from Egypt, the
blind king resumed the government, having returned from the
fens, where he had lived fifty years, on an island formed of ashes
and earth. For when any of the Egyptians came to him bringing
provisions, as they were severally ordered to do unknown to the
Ethiopian, he bade them bring some ashes also as a present.
The kings who preceded Amyrtæus were unable, for more than
seven hundred years, to find out where this island was. It was
called Elbo, and was about ten stades square.</p>

<p>After him reigned a priest of Vulcan, whose name was Sethon:
he held in no account the military caste of the Egyptians, as not
having need of their services; and accordingly, among other indignities,
he took away their lands; to each of whom, under former
kings, twelve chosen acres had been assigned. After this, when
Sennacherib, king of the Arabians and Assyrians, marched a large
army against Egypt, the Egyptian warriors refused to assist him;
and the priest, being reduced to a strait, entered the temple, and
bewailed before the image the calamities he was in danger of suffering.
While he was lamenting, sleep fell upon him, and it
appeared to him in a vision, that the god stood by and encouraged
him, assuring him that he should suffer nothing disagreeable in
meeting the Arabian army, for he would himself send assistants to
him. Confiding in this vision, he took with him such of the Egyptians
as were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusium, at
the entrance into Egypt; but none of the military caste followed
him, only tradesmen, mechanics, and sutlers. When they arrived
there, a number of field mice, pouring in upon their enemies, devoured
their quivers and their bows, and the handles of their
shields; so that on the next day, when they fled bereft of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
arms, many of them fell. And to this day, a stone statue of this
king stands in the temple of Vulcan, with a mouse in his hand,
and an inscription to the following effect: "Whoever looks on
me, let him revere the gods."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
The Egyptians and the priests show that from the first king to
this priest of Vulcan who last reigned, were three hundred and
forty-one generations of men; and the same number of chief priests
and kings. Now, three hundred generations are equal to ten
thousand years, for three generations of men are one hundred
years; and the forty-one remaining generations that were over
the three hundred, make one thousand three hundred and forty
years. Thus, they say, in eleven thousand three hundred and forty
years, no god has assumed the form of a man. They relate
that during this time the sun has four times risen out of his
usual quarter, and that he has twice risen where he now sets, and
twice set where he now rises; yet, that no change in the things in
Egypt was occasioned by this, either in respect to the productions
of the earth or the river, or to diseases or deaths.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>THIRD LINE; FROM THE TWELVE KINGS TO AMASIS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> things both other men and the Egyptians agree in saying
occurred in this country, I shall now proceed to relate, and
shall add to them some things of my own observation. The
Egyptians having become free, after the reign of the priest of Vulcan,
since they were at no time able to live without a king, divided
all Egypt into twelve parts and established twelve others.
These contracted intermarriages, and agreed that they would
not attempt the subversion of one another, and would maintain
the strictest friendship. They made these regulations and
strictly upheld them, for the reason that it had been foretold them
by an oracle when they first assumed the government, "that whoever
among them should offer a libation in the temple of Vulcan
from a bronze bowl, should be king of all Egypt"; for they used
to assemble in all the temples. Now, being determined to leave
in common a memorial of themselves, they built a labyrinth, a little
above the lake of Mœris, situated near that called the city of Crocodiles;
this I have myself seen, and found it greater than can be
described. For if any one should reckon up all the buildings
and public works of the Greeks, they would be found to have cost
less labor and expense than this labyrinth alone, though the temple
in Ephesus is deserving of mention, and also that in Samos. The
pyramids likewise were beyond description, and each of them comparable
to many of the great Greek structures. Yet the labyrinth
surpasses even the pyramids. For it has twelve courts enclosed
with walls, with doors opposite each other, six facing the north,
and six the south, contiguous to one another; and the same
exterior wall encloses them. It contains two kinds of rooms, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
under ground and some above, to the number of three thousand,
fifteen hundred of each. The rooms above ground I myself went
through and saw, and relate from personal inspection. But the
underground rooms I know only from report; for the Egyptians
who have charge of the building would, on no account, show me
them, saying that they held the sepulchres of the kings who
originally built this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. I can
therefore only relate what I have learnt by hearsay concerning the
lower rooms; but the upper ones, which surpass all human works,
I myself saw. The passages through the corridors, and the
windings through the courts, from their great variety, presented a
thousand occasions of wonder, as I passed from a court to the
rooms, and from the rooms to halls, and to other corridors from
the halls, and to other courts from the rooms. The roofs of all
these are of stone, as also are the walls; but the walls are full of
sculptured figures. Each court is surrounded with a colonnade of
white stone, closely fitted. And adjoining the extremity of the
labyrinth is a pyramid, forty orgyæ in height, on which large
figures are carved, and a way to it has been made under ground.</p>

<p>Yet more wonderful than this labyrinth is the lake named from
Mœris, near which this labyrinth is built; its circumference measures
three thousand six hundred stades, or a distance equal to the
sea-coast of Egypt. The lake stretches lengthways, north and south,
being in depth in the deepest part fifty orgyæ. That it is made by
hand and dry, this circumstance proves, for about the middle of the
lake stand two pyramids, each rising fifty orgyæ above the surface
of the water, and the part built under water extends to an equal
depth; on each of these is placed a stone statue, seated on a throne.
Thus these pyramids are one hundred orgyæ in height. The water
in this lake does not spring from the soil, for these parts are excessively
dry, but it is conveyed through a channel from the Nile, and
for six months it flows into the lake, and six months out again into
the Nile. And during the six months that it flows out it yields a
talent of silver every day to the king's treasury from the fish; but
when the water is flowing into it, twenty minæ. The people of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
country told me that this lake discharges itself under ground into
the Syrtis of Libya, running westward toward the interior by the
mountain above Memphis. But when I did not see anywhere a
heap of soil from this excavation, for this was an object of curiosity
to me, I inquired of the people who lived nearest the lake, where
the soil that had been dug out was to be found; they told me where
it had been carried, and easily persuaded me, because I had heard
that a similar thing had been done at Nineveh, in Assyria. For
certain thieves formed a design to carry away the treasures of Sardanapalus,
King of Nineveh, which were very large, and preserved
in subterraneous treasuries; the thieves, therefore, beginning from
their own dwellings, dug under ground by estimated measurement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
to the royal palace, and the soil that was taken out of the excavations,
when night came on, they threw into the river Tigris, that
flows by Nineveh; and so they proceeded until they had effected
their purpose. The same method I heard was adopted in digging
the lake in Egypt, except that it was not done by night, but during
the day; for the Egyptians who dug out the soil carried it to the
Nile, and the river receiving it, soon dispersed it.</p>

<p>While the twelve kings continued to observe justice, in course
of time, as they were sacrificing in the temple of Vulcan, and were
about to offer a libation on the last day of the festival, the high priest,
mistaking the number, brought out eleven of the twelve
golden bowls with which he used to make the libation. Whereupon
he who stood last of them, Psammitichus, since he had not
a bowl, having taken off his helmet, which was of bronze, held it out
and made the libation. All the other kings were in the habit of
wearing helmets, and at that time had them on. Psammitichus
therefore, without any sinister intention, held out his helmet; but
they having taken into consideration what was done by Psammitichus,
and the oracle that had foretold to them, "that whoever
among them should offer a libation from a bronze bowl, should be
sole king of Egypt"; calling to mind the oracle, did not think it
right to put him to death, since upon examination they found that
he had done it by no premeditated design. But they determined
to banish him to the marshes, having divested him of the greatest
part of his power; and they forbade him to leave the marshes, or
have any intercourse with the rest of Egypt. With the design of
avenging himself on his persecutors, he sent to the city of Buto to
consult the oracle of Latona, the truest oracle that the Egyptians
have, and the answer was returned "that vengeance would come
from the sea, when men of bronze should appear." He was very incredulous
that men of bronze would come to assist him; but not long
after a stress of weather compelled some Ionians and Carians, who
had sailed out for the purpose of piracy, to bear away to Egypt;
and when they had disembarked and were clad in bronze armor, an
Egyptian, who had never before seen men clad in such manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
went to the marshes to Psammitichus, and told him that men of
bronze had arrived from the sea, and were ravaging the plains. He
felt at once that the oracle was accomplished, and treated these
Ionians and Carians in a friendly manner, and by promising them
great things, persuaded them to join with him; and, with their help
and that of such Egyptians as were well disposed toward him, he
overcame the other kings.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>EGYPTIAN HELMETS.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Psammitichus, now master of all Egypt, constructed the portico
to Vulcan's temple at Memphis that faces the south wind; he
built a court for Apis, in which he is fed whenever he appears,
opposite the portico, surrounded by a colonnade, and full of sculptured
figures; and instead of pillars, statues twelve cubits high
are placed under the piazza. Apis, in the language of the Greeks,
means Epaphus. To the Ionians, and those who with them had
assisted him, Psammitichus gave
lands opposite each other, with
the Nile flowing between. These
bear the name of "Camps." He
royally fulfilled all his promises;
and he moreover put Egyptian
children under their care to be
instructed in the Greek language;
from whom the present interpreters in Egypt are descended.
The Ionians and the Carians continued for a long
time to inhabit these lands, situated near the sea, a little below
the city of Bubastis. They were the first people of a different
language who settled in Egypt. The docks for their ships, and
the ruins of their buildings, were to be seen in my time in the
places from which they had removed.</p>

<p>Psammitichus reigned in Egypt fifty-four years; during twenty-nine
of which he sat down before and besieged Azotus, a large
city of Syria, until he took it. This Azotus, of all the cities we
know of, held out against a siege the longest period. Neco was
son of Psammitichus, and became king of Egypt: he first set about
the canal that leads to the Red Sea, which Darius the Persian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
afterward completed. Its length is a voyage of four days, and in
width it was dug so that two triremes might sail rowed abreast.
The water is drawn into it from the Nile, and enters it a little
above the city Bubastis. The canal passes near the Arabian city
Patumos, and reaches to the Red Sea. In the digging of it one
hundred and twenty thousand Egyptians perished in the reign of
Neco.</p>

<p>Psammis his son reigned only six years over Egypt. He
made an expedition into Ethiopia, and shortly afterward died,
Apries his son succeeding to the kingdom. He, next to his
grandfather Psammitichus, enjoyed greater prosperity than any of
the former kings, during a reign of five and twenty years, in which
period he marched an army against Sidon, and engaged the
Tyrians by sea. But it was destined for him to meet with adversity.
For, having sent an army against the Cyrenæans, he met
with a signal defeat. And the Egyptians, complaining of this,
revolted from him, suspecting that Apries had designedly sent
them to certain ruin, in order that they might be destroyed, and
he might govern the rest of the Egyptians with greater security.
Both those that returned and the friends of those who perished,
being very indignant at this, openly revolted against him. Apries,
having heard of this, sent Amasis to appease them by persuasion.
But when he had come to them, and was urging them to desist
from their enterprise, one of the Egyptians, standing behind him,
placed a helmet on his head, and said: "I put this on you to
make you king." And this action was not at all disagreeable to
Amasis, as he presently showed. When Apries heard of this, he
armed his auxiliaries and marched against the Egyptians with
Carian and Ionian auxiliaries to the number of thirty thousand.
They met near the city Momemphis, and prepared to engage with
each other. Apries had a palace in the city of Sais that was spacious
and magnificent.</p>

<p>There are seven classes of people among the Egyptians&mdash;priests,
warriors, herdsmen, swineherds, tradesmen, interpreters,
and pilots. Their warriors are called Calasiries or Hermotybies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
The Hermotybies number, when they are most numerous, a hundred
and sixty thousand. None of these learn any business or
mechanical art, but apply themselves wholly to military affairs.
The Calasiries number two hundred and fifty thousand men: nor
are these allowed to practise any art, but they devote themselves
to military pursuits alone, the son succeeding to his father.</p>

<p>When Apries, leading his auxiliaries, and Amasis, all the
Egyptians, met together at Momemphis, the foreigners fought
well, but being far inferior in numbers, were, on that account,
defeated. Apries is said to have been of opinion that not even a
god could deprive him of his kingdom, so securely did he think
himself established; but he was beaten, taken prisoner, and carried
back to Sais, to that which was formerly his own palace, but which
now belonged to Amasis: here he was maintained for some time
in the royal palace, and Amasis treated him well. But at length
the Egyptians complaining that he did not act rightly in preserving
a man who was the greatest enemy both to them and to him, he
delivered Apries to the Egyptians. They strangled him, and buried
him in his ancestral sepulchre, in the sacred precinct of Minerva,
very near the temple, on the left hand as you enter.</p>

<p>Apries being thus dethroned, Amasis, who was of the Saitic
district, reigned in his stead; the name of the city from which he
came was Siuph. At first the Egyptians held him in no great estimation,
as having been formerly a private person, and of no illustrious
family; but afterward he conciliated them by an act of
address, without any arrogance. He had an infinite number of
treasures among them a golden foot-pan, in which Amasis himself
and all his guests were accustomed to wash their feet. This he
broke in pieces, had the statue of a god made from it, and placed
it in the most suitable part of the city. The Egyptians flocked to
the image and paid it the greatest reverence. Thus, Amasis called
the Egyptians together and said: "This statue was made out of
the foot-pan in which the Egyptians formerly spat and washed
their feet, and which they then so greatly reverenced; now, the
same has happened to me as to the foot-pan; for though I was before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
but a private person, I now am your king; you must therefore
honor and respect me." By this means he won over the
Egyptians, so that they thought fit to obey him. He adopted the
following method of managing his affairs: early in the morning,
until the time of full-market, he assiduously despatched the business
brought before him; after that he drank and jested with his companions,
and talked loosely and sportively. But his friends, offended
at this, admonished him, saying: "You do not, O king, control
yourself properly, in making yourself too common. For it
becomes you, who sit on a venerable throne, to pass the day in
transacting public business; thus the Egyptians would know that
they are governed by a great man, and you would be better
spoken of. But now you act in a manner not at all becoming a
king." But he answered them: "They who have bows, when
they want to use them, bend them; but when they have done
using them, they unbend them; for if the bow were to be kept
always bent, it would break. Such is the condition of man; if he
should incessantly attend to serious business, and not give himself
up sometimes to sport, he would shortly become mad or stupefied.
I, being well aware of this, give up a portion of my time to each."</p>

<p>He built an admirable portico to the temple of Minerva at Sais,
far surpassing all others both in height and size, as well as in the
dimensions and quality of the stones; he likewise dedicated large
statues, and huge andro-sphinxes, and brought other stones of a
prodigious size for repairs: some from the quarries near Memphis;
but those of greatest magnitude, from the city of Elephantine, distant
from Sais a passage of twenty days. But that which I rather
the most admire, is this: he brought a building of one stone from
the city of Elephantine, and two thousand men, who were appointed
to convey it, were occupied three whole years in its transport,
and these men were all pilots. The length of this chamber,
outside, is twenty-one cubits, the breadth fourteen, and the height
eight. But inside, the length is eighteen cubits and twenty digits,
the width twelve cubits, and the height five cubits. This chamber
is placed near the entrance of the sacred precinct; for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
say that he did not draw it within the precinct for the following
reason: the architect, as the chamber was being drawn along,
heaved a deep sigh, being wearied with the work, over which so
long a time had been spent; whereupon Amasis, making a religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
scruple of this, would not suffer it to be drawn any farther.
Some persons however say, that one of the men employed
at the levers was crushed to death by it, and that on that account
it was not drawn into the precinct. Amasis dedicated in all the
most famous temples, works admirable for their magnitude; and
amongst them, at Memphis, the reclining colossus before the
temple of Vulcan, of which the length is seventy-five feet; and
on the same base stand two statues of Ethiopian stone, each twenty
feet in height, one on each side of the temple. There is also at
Sais another similar statue, lying in the same manner as that at
Memphis. It was Amasis also who built the temple to Isis at
Memphis, which is spacious and well worthy of notice.</p>

    <p>THE GREAT SPHINX.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Under the reign of Amasis, Egypt is said to have enjoyed the
greatest prosperity, both in respect to the benefits derived from
the river to the land, and from the land to the people; and it is
said to have contained at that time twenty thousand inhabited
cities. Amasis it was who established the law among the Egyptians,
that every Egyptian should annually declare to the governor
of his district, by what means he maintained himself; and if he
failed to do this, or did not show that he lived by honest means,
he should be punished with death. Solon the Athenian brought
this law from Egypt and established it at Athens. Amasis, being
partial to the Greeks, bestowed other favors on various of the
Greeks, and gave the city of Naucratis for such as arrived in
Egypt to dwell in; and to such as did not wish to settle there, but
only to trade by sea, he granted places where they might erect
altars and temples to the gods. Now, the most spacious of these
sacred buildings, which is also the most renowned and frequented,
called the Hellenium, was erected at the common charge of the
following cities: of the Ionians,&mdash;Chios, Teos, Phocæa, and Clazomenæ;
of the Dorians,&mdash;Rhodes, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, Phaselis;
and of the Æolians,&mdash;Mitylene alone. So that this temple belongs
to them, and these cities appoint officers to preside over the mart:
and whatever other cities claim a share in it, claim what does not
belong to them. Besides this, the people of Ægina built a temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
to Jupiter for themselves; and the Samians another to Juno, and
the Milesians one to Apollo. Naucratis was anciently the only
place of resort for merchants, and there was no other in Egypt:
and if a man arrived at any other mouth of the Nile, he was
obliged to swear "that he had come there against his will"; and
having taken such an oath, he must sail in the same ship to the
Canopic mouth; but if he should be prevented by contrary winds
from doing so, he was forced to unload his goods and carry them
in barges round the Delta until he reached Naucratis. So great
were the privileges of Naucratis. When the Amphyctions contracted
to build the temple that now stands at Delphi for three
hundred talents&mdash;for the temple that was formerly there had been
burned by accident, and it fell upon the Delphians to supply a
fourth part of the sum&mdash;the Delphians went about from city to
city to solicit contributions, and brought home no small amount
from Egypt. For Amasis gave them a thousand talents of alum,
and the Greeks who were settled in Egypt twenty minæ.</p>

<p>Amasis also dedicated offerings in Greece. In the first place,
a gilded statue of Minerva at Cyrene, and his own portrait painted;
secondly, to Minerva in Lindus two stone statues and a linen
corselet well worthy of notice; thirdly, to Juno at Samos two
images of himself carved in wood, which stood in the large temple
even in my time, behind the doors. He was the first who conquered
Cyprus, and subjected it to the payment of tribute.</p>

<h2><i>BOOK III. THALIA.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>EXPEDITIONS OF CAMBYSES.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cambyses,</span> son of Cyrus, made war against Amasis, leading
with him his own subjects, together with Greeks, Ionians and
Æolians. The cause of the war was this: Cambyses sent a herald
into Egypt to demand the daughter of Amasis. The suggestion
was made by an Egyptian physician, who out of spite served
Amasis in this manner, because Amasis had selected him out of
all the physicians in Egypt, torn him from his wife and children,
and sent him as a present to the Persians, when Cyrus had sent
to Amasis, and required of him the best oculist in Egypt. The
Egyptian therefore, having this spite against him, urged on Cambyses
by his suggestions, bidding him demand the daughter of
Amasis, in order that if he should comply he might be grieved, or
if he refused he might incur the hatred of Cambyses. But Amasis,
dreading the power of the Persians, resorted to a piece of deceit.
There was a daughter of Apries, the former king, very tall and
beautiful, the only survivor of the family, named Nitetis. This
damsel, Amasis adorned with cloth of gold, and sent to Persia as
his own daughter. After a time, when Cambyses saluted her,
addressing her by her father's name, the damsel said to him: "O
king, you do not perceive that you have been imposed upon by
Amasis, who dressed me in rich attire, and sent me to you, presenting
me as his own daughter; whereas, I am really the daughter
of Apries, whom he put to death, after he had incited the Egyptians
to revolt." These words enraged Cambyses, and led him to
invade Egypt.</p>

    <p>EGYPTIAN POTTERY.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A circumstance that few of those who have made voyages to
Egypt have noticed, I shall now proceed to mention. From every
part of Greece, and also from Phœnicia, earthen vessels filled with
wine are imported into Egypt twice every year, and yet not a
single one of these wine jars is afterward to be seen. In what
way, then, you may ask, are they disposed of? Every magistrate
is obliged to collect all the vessels from his own city, and send
them to Memphis; the people of that city fill them with water,
and convey them to the arid parts of Syria; so that the earthen
vessels continually imported and landed in Egypt, are added to
those already in Syria. The Persians, as soon as they became
masters of Egypt, facilitated the passage into that country, by supplying
it with water in this manner. But as, at that time, water
was not provided, Cambyses, by the advice of a Halicarnassian
stranger, sent ambassadors to the Arabian, and requested a safe
passage, which he obtained, giving to, and receiving from him,
pledges of faith.</p>

<p>The Arabians observe pledges as religiously as any people:
when any wish to pledge their faith, a third person, standing between
the two parties, makes an incision with a sharp stone in the
palm of the hand, near the longest fingers, of both the contractors;
then taking some of the nap from the garment of each, he smears
seven stones, placed between them, with the blood; and as he
does this, he invokes Bacchus and Urania. When this ceremony
is completed, the person who pledges his faith, binds his friends as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
sureties to the stranger, or the citizen, if the contract be made with
a citizen, and the friends also hold themselves obliged to observe
the engagement. They acknowledge no other gods than Bacchus
and Urania, and they say that their hair is cut in the same way as
Bacchus' is cut, in a circular form, banged round the temples.
They call Bacchus, Orotal; and Urania, Alilat. When the
Arabian had exchanged pledges with the ambassadors who came
from Cambyses, he filled camels' skins with water, loaded them on
all his living camels, and drove them to the arid region, and there
awaited the army of Cambyses. This is the most credible of the
accounts that are given; yet it is right that one less credible should
be mentioned, since it is likewise affirmed. There is a large river
in Arabia called Corys, which discharges itself into the Red Sea.
From this river it is said that the king of the Arabians, having
sewn together a pipe of ox-hides and other skins, reaching in
length to the desert, conveyed the water through it; and that in
the arid region he dug large reservoirs, to receive and preserve the
water. It is a twelve days' journey from the river to the desert,
yet he conveyed water through three pipes into three different
places.</p>

<p>Amasis died after a reign of forty-four years, during which no
great calamity had befallen him. He was embalmed and buried
in the sepulchre within the sacred precinct, which he himself had
built. During the reign of Psammenitus, son of Amasis, a most
remarkable prodigy befell the Egyptians; rain fell at Egyptian
Thebes, which had never happened before, nor since, to my time,
as the Thebans themselves affirm. For no rain ever falls in the
upper regions of Egypt; but at that time rain fell in drops at
Thebes. The Persians, having marched through the arid region,
halted near the Egyptians, as if with a design of engaging; there
the auxiliaries of the Egyptians, consisting of Greeks and Carians,
condemning Phanes because he had led a foreign army against
Egypt, adopted the following expedient against him: Phanes had
left his sons in Egypt; these they brought to the camp, within
sight of their father, placed a bowl midway between the two armies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
then dragging the children one by one, they slew them over the
bowl, into which they also poured wine and water; then all the
auxiliaries drank of the blood, and immediately joined battle.
After a hard fight, when great numbers had fallen on both sides,
the Egyptians were put to flight. Here I saw a very surprising
fact, of which the people of the country informed me. As the
bones of those who were killed in that battle lie scattered about
separately, the bones of the Persians in one place, and those of the
Egyptians in another, the skulls of the Persians were so weak that
if you should hit one with a single pebble, you would break a hole
in it; whereas those of the Egyptians are so hard, that you could
scarcely fracture them by striking them with a stone. The cause
of this, they told me (and I readily assented), is that the Egyptians
begin from childhood to shave their heads, and the bone is thickened
by exposure to the sun; from the same cause also they are
less subject to baldness, and one sees fewer persons bald in Egypt
than in any other country. But the Persians have weak skulls, because
they shade them from the first, wearing tiaras for hats.</p>

<p>The Egyptians fled in complete disorder from the battle.
When they had shut themselves up in Memphis, Cambyses sent a
Mitylenæan bark up the river, with a Persian herald on board, to
invite the Egyptians to terms. But when they saw the bark entering
Memphis they rushed in a mass from the wall, destroyed the
ship, and having torn the crew to pieces, limb by limb, they carried
them into the citadel. After this the Egyptians were besieged,
and at length surrounded. The neighboring Libyans, fearing what
had befallen Egypt, gave themselves up without resistance, submitted
to pay a tribute, and sent presents, which Cambyses received
very graciously.</p>

<p>On the tenth day after Cambyses had taken the citadel of
Memphis, he seated Psammenitus, the King of the Egyptians, who
had reigned only six months, at the entrance of the city. And by
way of insult, he dressed his daughter in the habit of a slave, and
sent her with a pitcher to fetch water, with other maidens selected
from the principal families, dressed in the same manner. As the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
girls, with loud lamentation and weeping, came into the presence
of their fathers, all the other fathers answered them with wailing
and weeping, when they beheld their children thus humiliated. But
Psammenitus only bent his eyes to the ground. When these
water-carriers had passed by, he next sent his son, with two
thousand Egyptians of the same age, with halters about their
necks, and a bridle in their mouths; and they were led out to suffer
retribution for those Mitylenæans who had perished at Memphis
with the ship. For the royal judges had given sentence, that
for each man ten of the principal Egyptians should be put to death.
Yet, when he saw them passing by, and knew that his son was
being led out to death, though all the rest of the Egyptians who
sat round him wept and made loud lamentations, he did the same
as he had done in his daughter's case. But just then it happened
that one of his boon-companions, a man somewhat advanced in
years, who had lost his all, and possessed nothing but such things
as a beggar has, asking alms of the soldiery, passed by Psammenitus,
and the Egyptians seated in the suburbs. Then, indeed, he
wept bitterly, and calling his companion by name, smote his head.
Cambyses, surprised at this behavior, sent a messenger to say:
"Psammenitus, your master Cambyses inquires why, when you
saw your daughter humiliated and your son led to execution, you
did not bewail or lament; and have been so highly concerned for
a beggar, who is no way related to you, as he is informed."
Psammenitus answered: "Son of Cyrus, the calamities of my
family are too great to be expressed by lamentation; but the
griefs of my friend were worthy of tears, who, having fallen from
abundance and prosperity, has come to beggary on the threshold
of old age." When this answer was brought back by the messenger,
it appeared to Cambyses to be well said; and, as the Egyptians
relate, Crœsus wept, for he had attended Cambyses into
Egypt, and the Persians that were present wept also; Cambyses
himself, touched with pity, gave immediate orders to preserve his
son out of those who were to perish, but those who were sent
found the son no longer alive, having been the first that suffered;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
but Psammenitus himself they conducted to Cambyses, with whom
he afterward lived, without experiencing any violence. And had
it not been suspected that he was planning innovations, he would
probably have recovered Egypt, so as to have the government intrusted
to him. For the Persians are accustomed to honor the
sons of kings, and even if they have revolted from them, sometimes
bestow the government upon their children. Psammenitus, devising
mischief, received his reward, for he was discovered inciting
the Egyptians to revolt; and when he was detected by Cambyses
he was compelled to drink the blood of a bull, and died immediately.</p>

<p>Cambyses proceeded from Memphis to the city of Sais, and
entering the palace of Amasis, commanded the dead body of
Amasis to be brought out of the sepulchre; he gave orders then
to scourge it, to pull off the hair, to prick it, and to abuse it in
every possible manner. But when they were wearied with this
employment, for the dead body, since it was embalmed, resisted,
and did not at all fall in pieces, Cambyses gave orders to burn it,
commanding what is impious. For to burn the dead is on no
account allowed by either nation: not by the Persians, for they
consider fire to be a god, and say it is not right to offer to a god
the dead body of a man; nor by the Egyptians, as fire is held by
them to be a living beast, which devours every thing it can lay
hold of, and when it is glutted with food it expires with what it
has consumed; therefore, as it is their law on no account to give a
dead body to wild beasts, for that reason they embalm them, that
they may not lie and be eaten by worms.</p>

<p>Cambyses determined to send to Elephantine for some of the
Ichthyophagi, who understood the Ethiopian language, that he
might despatch them as spies to Ethiopia. When the Ichthyophagi
came, he despatched them to the Ethiopians, having instructed
them what to say, carrying presents, consisting of a purple
cloak, a golden necklace, bracelets, an alabaster box of ointment,
and a cask of palm wine. These Ethiopians, to whom Cambyses
sent, are said to be the tallest and handsomest of all men; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
have customs different from those of other nations, especially with
regard to the regal power; for they confer the sovereignty upon
the man whom they consider to be of the largest stature, and to
possess strength proportionate to his size.</p>

<p>When the Ichthyophagi arrived among this people, they gave
the presents to the king, and addressed him as follows: "Cambyses,
King of the Persians, desirous of becoming your friend and
ally, has sent us to confer with you, and he presents you with
these gifts, which are such as he himself most delights in." But
the Ethiopian, knowing that they came as spies, spoke thus to
them: "Neither has the king of the Persians sent you with
presents to me, because he valued my alliance; nor do you speak
the truth; for ye are come as spies of my kingdom. Nor is he a
just man; for if he were just, he would not desire any other territory
than his own; nor would he reduce people into servitude
who have done him no injury. However, give him this bow, and
say these words to him: 'The king of the Ethiopians advises the
king of the Persians, when the Persians can thus easily draw a
bow of this size, then to make war on the Macrobian Ethiopians
with more numerous forces; but until that time let him thank the
gods, who have not inspired the sons of the Ethiopians with a
desire of adding another land to their own.'" Having spoken thus
and unstrung the bow, he delivered it to the comers. Then taking
up the purple cloak, he asked what it was, and how made; and
when the Ichthyophagi told him the truth respecting the purple,
and the manner of dyeing, he said that the men are deceptive, and
their garments are deceptive also. Next he inquired about the
necklace and bracelets, and when the Ichthyophagi explained to
him their use as ornaments, the king, laughing, and supposing
them to be fetters, said that they have stronger fetters than these.
Thirdly, he inquired about the ointment; and when they told him
about its composition and use, he made the same remark as he had
on the cloak. But when he came to the wine, and inquired how it
was made, being very much delighted with the draught, he further
asked what food the king made use of, and what was the longest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
age to which a Persian lived. They answered, that he fed on
bread, describing the nature of wheat; and that the longest period
of the life of a Persian was eighty years. Upon this the Ethiopian
said, that he was not at all surprised if men who fed on earth lived
so few years; and he was sure they would not be able to live even
so many years, if they did not refresh themselves with this beverage,
showing the wine to the Ichthyophagi: for in this he
admitted they were surpassed by the Persians. The Ichthyophagi
inquiring in turn of the king concerning the life and diet of the
Ethiopians, he said, that most of them attained to a hundred and
twenty years, and some even exceeded that term, and that their
food was boiled flesh, and their drink milk. When the spies
expressed their astonishment at the number of years, he led them
to a fountain, by washing in which they became more sleek, as if
it had been of oil, and an odor proceeded from it as of violets.
The water of this fountain, the spies said, is so weak, that nothing
is able to float upon it, neither wood, nor such things as are lighter
than wood; but every thing sinks to the bottom. If this water is
truly such as it is said to be, it may be they are long-lived by reason
of the abundant use of it. Leaving this fountain, he conducted
them to the common prison, where all were fettered with
golden chains; for among these Ethiopians bronze is the most rare
and precious of all metals. After this, they visited last of all their
sepulchres, which are said to be prepared from crystal in the following
manner. When they have dried the body, either as the
Egyptians do, or in some other way, they plaster it all over with
gypsum, and paint it, making it as much as possible to resemble
real life; they then put round it a hollow column made of crystal,
which they dig up in abundance, and is easily wrought. The body
being in the middle of the column is plainly seen, and it does not
emit an unpleasant smell, nor is it in any way offensive; and it is all
visible<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
as the body itself. The nearest relations keep the column
in their houses for a year, offering to it the first-fruits of all, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
performing sacrifices; after that time they carry it out and place it
somewhere near the city.</p>

<p>When the spies returned home and reported all that had
passed, Cambyses, in a great rage, immediately marched against
the Ethiopians, without making any provision for the subsistence
of his army, or once considering that he was going to carry his
arms to the remotest parts of the world; but, as a madman, and
not in possession of his senses, as soon as he heard the report of
the Icthyophagi, he set out on his march, ordering the Greeks who
were present to stay behind, and taking with him all his land forces.
When the army reached Thebes, he detached about fifty thousand
men, and ordered them to reduce the Ammonians to slavery, and
to burn the oracular temple of Jupiter, while he with the rest of his
army marched against the Ethiopians. But before the army had
passed over a fifth part of the way, all the provisions that they had
were exhausted, and the beasts of burden themselves were eaten.
Now if Cambyses had at this juncture altered his purpose, and
had led back his army, he would have proved himself to be a wise
man. But he obstinately continued advancing. The soldiers
supported life by eating herbs as long as they could gather any
from the ground; but when they reached the sands, some of them
had recourse to a dreadful expedient, for taking one man in ten by
lot, they devoured him: when Cambyses heard this, shocked at
their eating one another, he abandoned his expedition against the
Ethiopians, marched back and reached Thebes, after losing a great
part of his army. From Thebes he went down to Memphis, and
suffered the Greeks to sail away. Thus ended the expedition
against the Ethiopians. Those who had been sent against the
Ammonians, after having set out from Thebes, under the conduct
of guides, are known to have reached the city Oasis, which is inhabited
by Samians, distant seven days' march from Thebes,
across the sands. This country in the Greek language is called the
Island of the Blessed. But afterward none, except the Ammonians
and those who have heard their report, are able to give any
account of them; for they neither reached the Ammonians, nor returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
back. But the Ammonians make the following report:
When they had advanced from this Oasis toward them across the
sands, and were about half-way between them and Oasis, as they
were taking dinner, a vehement south wind blew, carrying with it
heaps of sand, and completely destroyed the whole army.</p>

    <p>SAND STORM IN THE DESERT.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis, whom the Greeks
call Epaphus, appeared to the Egyptians; and when this manifestation
took place, the Egyptians immediately put on their richest
apparel, and kept festive holiday. Cambyses, seeing them thus
occupied, and concluding that they made these rejoicings on account
of his ill success, summoned the magistrates of Memphis; and
when they came into his presence, he asked "why the Egyptians
had done nothing of the kind when he was at Memphis before, but
did so now, when he had returned with the loss of a great part of
his army." They answered, that their god appeared to them, who
was accustomed to manifest himself at intervals, and that when
he did appear, then all the Egyptians were accustomed to rejoice
and keep a feast. Cambyses, having heard this, said they were
liars, and put them to death. Then he summoned the priests into
his presence, and when the priests gave the same account, he said,
that he would find out whether a god so tractable had come among
the Egyptians; and commanded the priests to bring Apis to him.
This Apis, or Epaphus, the Egyptians say, is the calf of a cow upon
which the lightning has descended from heaven. It is black, and
has a square spot of white on the forehead; on the back the figure
of an eagle; and in the tail double hairs; and on the tongue a
beetle. When the priests brought Apis, Cambyses, like one almost
out of his senses, drew his dagger, meaning to strike the belly of
Apis, but hit the thigh; then falling into a fit of laughter, he said to
the priests: "Ye blockheads, are there such gods as these, consisting
of blood and flesh, and sensible of steel? This, truly, is a god
worthy of the Egyptians. But you shall not mock me with impunity."
Then he gave orders to scourge the priests, and kill all
the Egyptians who should be found feasting. Apis, wounded in
the thigh, lay and languished in the temple; and at length, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
he had died of the wound, the priests buried him without the knowledge
of Cambyses.</p>

<p>But Cambyses, as the Egyptians say, immediately became mad
in consequence of this atrocity, though he really was not of sound
mind before. His first crime he committed against his brother
Smerdis, who was born of the same father and mother; him he
sent back from Egypt to Persia through envy, because he alone of
all the Persians had drawn the bow, which the Ichthyophagi brought
from the Ethiopian, within two fingers' breadth; of the other Persians
no one was able to do this. After the departure of Smerdis
for Persia, Cambyses saw the following vision in his sleep: he imagined
that a messenger arrived from Persia and informed him that
Smerdis was seated on the royal throne, and touched the heavens
with his head. Upon this, fearing for himself, lest his brother
should kill him, and reign, he sent Prexaspes, the most faithful to
him of the Persians, to Persia, with orders to kill Smerdis. Having
gone up to Susa, he killed Smerdis; some say, when he had taken
him out to hunt; but others, that he led him to the Red Sea and
drowned him. This they say was the first of the crimes of Cambyses;
the second was that of marrying his own sister, who had
accompanied him into Egypt.</p>

<p>The Greeks say, that one day Cambyses made the whelp of a
lion fight with a young dog; and this wife was also looking on;
the dog being over-matched, another puppy of the same litter
broke his chain, and came to his assistance, and thus the two dogs
united got the better of the whelp. Cambyses was delighted at
the sight, but she, sitting by him, shed tears. Cambyses, observing
this, asked her why she wept. She answered, that she wept
seeing the puppy come to the assistance of his brother, remembering
Smerdis, and knowing that there was no one to avenge him.
The Greeks say, that for this speech she was put to death by
Cambyses. But the Egyptians say, that as they were sitting at
table, his wife took a lettuce, stripped off its leaves, and then asked
her husband "whether the lettuce stripped of its leaves, or thick
with foliage, was the handsomer." He said: "When thick with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
foliage." Whereupon she remarked: "Then you have imitated
this lettuce, in dismembering the house of Cyrus." Whereupon
he, in rage, kicked her and inflicted such injuries that she died.</p>

<p>Thus madly did Cambyses behave toward his own family;
whether on account of Apis, or from some other cause, from which,
in many ways, misfortunes are wont to befall mankind. For Cambyses
is said, even from infancy, to have been afflicted with a
certain severe malady, which some called the sacred disease.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
In that case, it was not at all surprising that, when his body was so
diseased, his mind should not be sound. And toward the other
Persians he behaved madly in the following instances: for it is
reported that he said to Prexaspes, whom he highly honored, and
whose office it was to bring messages to him, whose son was cupbearer
to Cambyses, no trifling honor by any means, he is reported
to have said: "Prexaspes, what sort of a man do the Persians
think me? and what remarks do they make about me?" He
answered: "Sir, you are highly extolled in every other respect, but
they say you are too much addicted to wine." The king enraged
cried out: "Do the Persians indeed say that, by being addicted
to wine, I am beside myself, and am not in my senses? then their
former words were not true." For, on a former occasion, when
the Persians and Crœsus were sitting with him, Cambyses asked,
what sort of a man he appeared to be in comparison with his
father Cyrus; they answered, that he was superior to his father,
because he held all that Cyrus possessed, and had acquired besides
Egypt and the empire of the sea. Crœsus, who was not pleased
with this decision, spoke thus to Cambyses: "To me, O son of
Cyrus, you do not appear comparable to your father, for you have
not yet such a son as he left behind him." Cambyses was
delighted at hearing this, and commended the judgment of Crœsus.
So, remembering this, he said in anger to Prexaspes: "Observe
now yourself, whether the Persians have spoken the truth, or
whether they who say such things are not out of their senses: for
if I shoot that son of yours who stands under the portico, and hit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
him in the heart, the Persians will appear to have said nothing to
the purpose; but if I miss, then say that the Persians have spoken
the truth, and that I am not of sound mind." Having said this,
and bent his bow, he hit the boy; and when the boy had fallen,
he ordered them to open him and examine the wound; and when
the arrow was found in the heart, he said to the boy's father,
laughing: "Prexaspes, it has been clearly shown to you that I am
not mad, but that the Persians are out of their senses. Now tell
me, did you ever see a man take so true an aim?" But Prexaspes,
perceiving him to be out of his mind, and being in fear for his own
life, said: "Sir, I believe that a god himself could not have shot
so well." At another time, having, without any just cause, seized
twelve Persians of the first rank, he had them buried alive up to
the head.</p>

<p>While he was acting in this manner, Crœsus the Lydian
thought fit to admonish him in the following terms: "O king, do
not yield entirely to your youthful impulses and anger, but possess
and restrain yourself. It is a good thing to be provident, and wise
to have forethought. You put men to death who are your own
subjects, having seized them without any just cause; and you slay
their children. If you persist in such a course, beware lest the
Persians revolt from you. Your father Cyrus strictly charged me
to admonish you, and suggest whatever I might discover for your
good." He thus manifested his good-will, in giving this advice;
but Cambyses answered: "Do you presume to give me advice,
you, who so wisely managed your own country; and so well advised
my father, when you persuaded him to pass the river Araxes,
and advance against the Massagetæ, when they were willing to
cross over into our territory? You have first ruined yourself by
badly governing your own country, and then ruined Cyrus, who
was persuaded by your advice. But you shall have no reason to
rejoice; for I have long wanted to find a pretext against you."
So saying, he took up his bow for the purpose of shooting him;
but Crœsus jumped up and ran out. Cambyses, unable to shoot
him, commanded his attendants to seize him, and put him to death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
But the attendants, knowing his temper, concealed Crœsus for the
following reason, that if Cambyses should repent, and inquire for
Crœsus, they, by producing him, might receive rewards for preserving
him alive; or if he should not repent, or sorrow for him,
then they would put him to death. Not long afterward Cambyses
did regret the loss of Crœsus, whereupon the attendants acquainted
him that he was still living; on which Cambyses said: "I am rejoiced
that Crœsus is still alive; they, however, who disobeyed my
orders and saved him, shall not escape with impunity, but I will
have them put to death." And he made good his word.</p>

<p>He committed many such mad actions, both against the Persians
and his allies, while he stayed at Memphis opening ancient sepulchres,
and examining the dead bodies; he also entered the temple
of Vulcan, and derided the image, for the image of Vulcan is
very much like the Phœnician Pataici, which the Phœnicians place
at the prows of their triremes, and is a representation of a pigmy.
He likewise entered the temple of the Cabeiri, (into which it is
unlawful for any one except the priest to enter) and these images
he burnt, after he had ridiculed them in various ways: these also
are like that of Vulcan; and they say that they are the sons of this
latter. It is in every way clear to me that Cambyses was outrageously
mad; otherwise he would not have attempted to deride
sacred things and established customs. For if any one should propose
to all men, to select the best institutions of all that exist, each,
after considering them all, would choose his own; so certain is it
that each thinks his own institutions by far the best. It is not
therefore probable, that any but a madman would make such things
the subject of ridicule. That all men are of this mind respecting
their own institutions may be inferred from many proofs, but is
well illustrated by the following incident: Darius once summoned
some Greeks under his sway, and asked them "for what sum they
would feed upon the dead bodies of their parents." They answered,
that they would not do it for any sum. Then Darius called to
him some of the Indians called Callatians, who are accustomed to
eat their parents, and asked them, in the presence of the Greeks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
"for what sum they would consent to burn their fathers when they
die." But they made loud exclamations and begged he would
speak words of good omen. Such then is the effect of custom:
and Pindar appears to me to have said rightly "that custom is
the king of all men."</p>

<p>Whilst Cambyses was invading Egypt, the Lacedæmonians
made an expedition against Polycrates, who had made an insurrection
and seized on Samos. At first, having divided the state into
three parts, he had shared it with his brothers Pantagnotus and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
Syloson; but afterward, having put one of them to death, and expelled
Syloson, the younger, he held the whole of Samos, and
made a treaty of friendship with Amasis, King of Egypt, sending
presents, and receiving others from him in return. In a very short
time the power of Polycrates increased, and was noised abroad
throughout Ionia and the rest of Greece; for wherever he turned
his arms, everything turned out prosperously. He had a hundred
fifty-oared galleys, and a thousand archers. And he plundered all
without distinction; for he said that he gratified a friend more by
restoring what he had seized, than by taking nothing at all. He
accordingly took many of the islands, and many cities on the continent;
he moreover overcame in a sea-fight, and took prisoners,
the Lesbians, who came to assist the Milesians with all their forces;
these, being put in chains, dug the whole trench that surrounds the
walls of Samos.</p>

<p>The Lacedæmonians, arriving with a great armament, besieged
Samos, attacked the fortifications, and passed beyond the tower
that faced the sea near the suburbs; but afterward, when Polycrates
himself advanced with a large force, they were driven back,
and after forty days had been spent in besieging Samos, finding
their affairs were not at all advanced, they returned to Peloponnesus;
though a groundless report got abroad, that Polycrates coined a
large quantity of the money of the country in lead, had it gilt, and
gave it to them; whereupon they took their departure. This
was the first expedition that the Lacedæmonian Dorians undertook
against Asia.</p>

<p>Those of the Samians who had fomented the war against Polycrates
set sail for Siphnus when the Lacedæmonians were about to
abandon them, for they were in want of money. The Siphnians
were at that time the richest of all the islanders, having such gold
and silver mines, that from the tenth of the money accruing from
them, a treasure was laid up at Delphi equal to the richest; and
they used every year to divide the product of the mines. When
they established this treasure, they asked the oracle, whether their
present prosperity would continue with them for a long time; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
the Pythian answered as follows: "When the Prytaneum in Siphnus
shall be white, and the market white-fronted, then shall there
be need of a prudent man to guard against a wooden ambush and
a crimson herald." The market and Prytaneum of the Siphnians
were then adorned with Parian marble. As soon as the Samians
reached Siphnus, they sent ambassadors to the city in a ship which,
like all ships at that time, was painted red. And this was what
the Pythian meant by a wooden ambush and a crimson herald.
These ambassadors requested the Siphnians to lend them ten
talents; the Siphnians refused the loan, and the Samians proceeded
to ravage their territory. The Siphnians were beaten, and compelled
to give a hundred talents.</p>

<p>I have dwelt longer on the affairs of the Samians, because they
have the three greatest works that have been accomplished by all
the Greeks. The first is a mountain, one hundred and fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
orgyæ in height, in which is dug a tunnel, beginning from the
base, with an opening at each side. The length of the excavation
is seven stades, and the height and breadth eight feet each;
through the whole length of it is dug another excavation twenty
cubits deep, and three feet broad, through which the water conveyed
by pipes reaches the city, drawn from a copious fountain.
The architect of this excavation was a Megarian, Eupalinus, son
of Naustrophus. The second work is a mound in the sea round
the harbor, in depth about one hundred orgyæ; and in length
more than two stades. The third is a temple, the largest of all
we have ever seen; of this, the architect was Rhœcus, son of
Phileus, a native.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>USURPATION OF SMERDIS THE MAGUS AND ACCESSION OF DARIUS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Cambyses, son of Cyrus, tarried in Egypt, and was acting
madly, two magi, who were brothers, revolted. One of these, Cambyses
had left steward of his palace, the other was a person
very much like Smerdis, son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses, his own
brother, had put to death. The magus Patizithes, having persuaded
this man that he would manage every thing for him, set
him on the throne; and sent heralds in various directions, particularly
to Egypt, to proclaim to the army, that they must in future
obey Smerdis, son of Cyrus, and not Cambyses. The herald who
was appointed to Egypt, finding Cambyses and his army at Ecbatana
in Syria, stood in the midst and proclaimed what had been
ordered by the magus. Cambyses, believing that he spoke the
truth, and that he had himself been betrayed by Prexaspes, and
that he, when sent to kill Smerdis, had not done so, looked
toward Prexaspes, and said: "Prexaspes, hast thou thus performed
the business I enjoined upon thee?" But he answered: "Sire, it is
not true that your brother Smerdis has revolted against you, nor that
you can have any quarrel, great or small, with him. For I myself
put your order into execution, and buried him with my own hands.
I think I understand the whole matter, O king: the magi are
the persons who have revolted against you,&mdash;Patizithes, whom you
left steward of the palace, and his brother Smerdis." When Cambyses
heard the name of Smerdis, the truth of this account and of
the dream struck him: for he fancied in his sleep that some one
announced to him that Smerdis, seated on the royal throne,
touched the heavens with his head. Perceiving, therefore, that he
had destroyed his brother without a cause, he wept bitterly for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
him, deplored the whole calamity, and leapt upon his horse, resolving
with all speed to march to Susa against the magus. But as he
was leaping on his horse, the chape of his sword's scabbard fell off,
and the blade, being laid bare, struck the thigh; wounding him in
that part where he himself had formerly smitten the Egyptian god
Apis. Mortally wounded, he asked what was the name of the
city. They said it was Ecbatana. And it had been before prophesied
to him from the city of Buto, that he should end his life in
Ecbatana. He had imagined that he should die an old man in
Ecbatana of Media, where all his treasures were; but the oracle in
truth meant in Ecbatana of Syria. When he had thus been
informed of the name of the city, though smitten by misfortune, he
returned to his right mind; and comprehending the oracle, said:
"Here it is fated that Cambyses, son of Cyrus, should die."</p>

<p>Twenty days later he summoned the principal men of the Persians
who were with him, told them his vision and his great mistake,
shed bitter tears, and charged them never to permit the
government to return into the hands of the Medes. When the
Persians saw their king weep, all rent the garments they had
on, and gave themselves up to lamentation. Soon the bone
became infected, the thigh mortified, and Cambyses, son of Cyrus,
died, after he had reigned in all seven years and five months,
having never had any children. Great incredulity stole over the
Persians who were present, as to the story that the magi had
possession of the government, and agreed that it must be Smerdis,
son of Cyrus, who had risen up and seized the kingdom. Prexaspes,
moreover, vehemently denied that he had killed Smerdis; for it
was not safe for him, now that Cambyses was dead, to own that
he had killed the son of Cyrus with his own hand.</p>

<p>The magus, after the death of Cambyses, relying on his having
the same name as Smerdis the son of Cyrus, reigned securely during
the seven months that remained to complete the eighth year
of Cambyses; in which time he treated all his subjects with such
beneficence, that at his death, all the people of Asia, except the
Persians, regretted his loss. For the magus, on assuming the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
sovereignty, despatched messengers to every nation he ruled over,
and proclaimed a general exemption from military service and
tribute for the space of three years. But in the eighth month he
was discovered in the following manner. Otanes, son of Pharnaspes,
was by birth and fortune equal to the first of the Persians.
This Otanes first suspected the magus not to be Smerdis the son
of Cyrus, from the fact, that he never went out of the citadel, and
that he never summoned any of the principal men of Persia to his
presence. Having conceived suspicion of him, he contrived the
following artifice. Cambyses had married his daughter, whose
name was Phædyma; the magus of course had her as his wife, as
well as all the rest of the wives of Cambyses. Otanes therefore,
sending to his daughter, inquired whether her husband was Smerdis,
son of Cyrus, or some other person; she sent back word to
him, saying that she did not know. Otanes sent a second time,
saying: "If you do not yourself know Smerdis, son of Cyrus, then
inquire of Atossa, for she must of necessity know her own brother."
To this his daughter replied: "I can neither have any conversation
with Atossa, nor see any of the women who used to live with me;
for as soon as this man, whoever he is, succeeded to the throne, he
dispersed us all, assigning us separate apartments." When Otanes
heard this, the matter appeared much more plain; and he sent a
third message to her in these words: "Daughter, it becomes you,
being of noble birth, to undertake any peril that your father may
require you to incur. For if this Smerdis is not the son of Cyrus,
but the person whom I suspect, it is not fit that he should escape
with impunity, but suffer the punishment due to his offences. Now
follow my directions: watch your opportunity, and whenever you
discover him to be sound asleep, touch his ears; and if you find
he has ears, be assured that he is Smerdis, son of Cyrus; but if he
has none, then he is Smerdis the magus." To this message Phædyma
answered, saying "that she should incur very great danger
by doing so; for he kept the sides of his head concealed, and if he
had no ears, and she should be discovered touching him, she well
knew that he would put her to death; nevertheless she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
make the attempt." Cyrus, during his reign, had cut off the ears
of this Smerdis the magus, for some grave offence. Phædyma,
therefore, determining to execute all that she had promised her
father, catching the magus sound asleep on his couch one day felt
for his ears, and perceiving without any difficulty that the man had
no ears, as soon as it was day, she sent and made known to her
father what the case was.</p>

<p>Thereupon Otanes, having taken with him Aspathines and
Gobryas, who were the noblest of the Persians, and persons on
whom he could best rely, related to them the whole affair; and
they agreed that each should associate with himself a Persian in
whom he could place most reliance. Otanes accordingly introduced
Intaphernes; Gobryas, Megabyzus; and Aspathines, Hydarnes.
Just at this time Darius, son of Hystaspes, arrived at Susa
from Persia, where his father was governor, and the six Persians
determined to admit Darius to the confederacy. These seven
met, exchanged pledges with each other, and conferred together.
When it came to the turn of Darius to declare his opinion, he addressed
them as follows: "I thought that I was the only person
who knew that it was the magus who reigns, and that Smerdis, son
of Cyrus, is dead; and for this very reason I hastened hither in
order to contrive the death of the magus. But since it proves that
you also are acquainted with the fact, it appears to me that we
should act immediately." Otanes said to this: "Son of Hystaspes,
you are born of a noble father, and show yourself not at all inferior
to him; do not, however, so inconsiderately hasten this enterprise,
but set about it with more caution; for we must increase our numbers,
and then attempt it." Darius replied to this: "Be assured,
ye men who are here present, if you adopt the plan proposed by
Otanes, you will all miserably perish; for some one will discover it
to the magus, consulting his own private advantage; indeed, you
ought to have carried out your project immediately, without communicating
it to any one else; but since you have thought fit to
refer it to others, and have disclosed it to me, let us carry it out
this very day, or be assured, that if this day passes over, no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
shall be beforehand with me and become my accuser, but I myself
will denounce you to the magus." Otanes, seeing Darius so
eager, replied: "Since you compel us to precipitate our enterprise,
and will not permit us to defer it, tell us in what way we are
to enter the palace and attack him; for you yourself know that
guards are stationed at intervals; and how shall we pass them?"
"There are many things," said Darius, "that can not be made clear
by words, but may by action; and there are other things that seem
practicable in description, but no signal effect proceeds from them.
Be assured that the guards stationed there will not be at all difficult
to pass by: for in the first place, seeing our rank, there is no
one who will not allow us to pass, partly from respect, and partly
from fear; and in the next place, I have a most specious pretext
by which we shall gain admission, for I will say that I have just
arrived from Persia, and wish to report a message to the king from
my father. For when a lie must be told, let it be told. Whoever
of the doorkeepers shall willingly let us pass, shall be rewarded in
due time; but whoever offers to oppose us must instantly be
treated as an enemy." After this Gobryas said: "Friends, shall
we ever have a better opportunity to recover the sovereign power,
or if we shall be unable to do so, to die? seeing we who are Persians,
are governed by an earless Medic magus. Those among
you who were present with Cambyses when he lay sick, well
remember the imprecations he uttered at the point of death against
the Persians, if they should not attempt to repossess themselves of
the sovereign power: we did not then believe this story, but
thought that Cambyses spoke from ill-will. I give my voice that
we yield to Darius, and that on breaking up this conference we go
direct to the magus." And all assented to his proposal.</p>

<p>Meantime the magi, on consultation, determined to make Prexaspes
their friend: both because he had suffered grievous wrong
from Cambyses, who shot his son dead with an arrow; and because
he alone of all the Persians knew of the death of Smerdis, son of
Cyrus, as he had despatched him with his own hand; and moreover,
Prexaspes was in high repute with the Persians. Therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
having sent for Prexaspes, they endeavored to win his friendship,
binding him by pledges and oaths, that he would never divulge
to any man the cheat they had put upon the Persians, assuring him
that in return they would give him every thing his heart could
desire. When Prexaspes had promised that he would do as the
magi wished, they made a second proposal, saying, that they would
assemble all the Persians under the walls of the palace, and desired
that he would ascend a tower, and assure them that they were
governed by Smerdis, son of Cyrus. Prexaspes assented, and the
magi, having convoked the Persians, placed him on the top of a
turret, and commanded him to harangue the people. But he purposely
forgot what they desired him to say, and, beginning from
Achæmenes, described the genealogy of Cyrus' family; told them
what great benefits Cyrus had done the Persians; and finally declared
the whole truth, saying that he had before concealed it, as
it was not safe for him to tell what had happened; but that in the
present emergency necessity constrained him to make it known.
He accordingly told them that he, being compelled by Cambyses,
had put Smerdis, son of Cyrus, to death, and that it was the magi
who then reigned. After he had uttered many imprecations against
the Persians, if they should not recover back the sovereign power,
and punish the magi, he threw himself headlong from the tower.
Thus died Prexaspes, a man highly esteemed during the course
of his whole life.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The seven Persians, resolving to attack the magi without delay,
had offered prayers to the gods, and were in the midst of their way
when they were informed of all that Prexaspes had done, whereupon
they again conferred together; and some, with Otanes, strongly
advised to defer the enterprise while affairs were in such a ferment;
but others, with Darius, urged to proceed at once. While hotly
disputing there appeared seven pairs of hawks pursuing two pairs
of vultures, and plucking and tearing them. The seven, on seeing
this, all approved the opinion of Darius, and forthwith proceeded to
the palace, emboldened by the omen. When they approached the
gates, it happened as Darius had supposed; for the guards, out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
respect for men of highest rank among the Persians, and not suspecting
any such design on their part, let them pass by, moved as
they were by divine impulse; nor did any one question them. But
when they reached the hall, they fell in with the eunuchs appointed
to carry in messages, who inquired of them for what purpose they
had come; and at the same time that they questioned them they
threatened the doorkeepers for permitting them to pass, and endeavored
to prevent the seven from proceeding any farther. They
instantly drew their daggers, stabbed all that opposed their passage
on the spot, and then rushed to the men's apartment. The magi
happened to be both within at the time, and were consulting about
the conduct of Prexaspes. But seeing the eunuchs in confusion,
and hearing their outcry, they hurried out, and put themselves
on the defensive. One snatched up a bow, and the other a javelin,
and the parties engaged with each other. The one who had taken
up the bow, seeing his enemies were near and pressing upon them,
found it of no use; but the other made resistance with his spear,
and first wounded Aspathines in the thigh, and next Intaphernes in
the eye; and Intaphernes lost his eye from the wound, but did not
die. The other magus, when he found his bow of no service, fled
to a chamber adjoining the men's apartment, purposing to shut to
the door, and two of the seven, Darius and Gobryas, rushed in with
him; and as Gobryas was grappling with the magus, Darius standing
by was in perplexity, fearing that he should strike Gobryas in
the dark; but Gobryas, seeing that he stood by inactive, asked him
why he did not use his hand. He answered: "Fearing for you, lest
I should strike you." "Never mind," said Gobryas, "drive your
sword through both of us." Darius obeyed, thrust with his dagger,
and by good fortune hit the magus.</p>

<p>Having slain the magi, and cut off their heads, they left the
wounded of their own party there, as well on account of their exhaustion
as to guard the acropolis; but the other five of them,
carrying the heads of the magi, ran out with shouting and clamor,
and called upon the rest of the Persians, relating what they had
done, and showing them the heads; and at the same time they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
slew every one of the magi that came in their way. The Persians,
informed of what had been done by the seven, and of the fraud of
the magi, determined themselves also to do the like; and having
drawn their daggers, they slew every magus they could find; and
if the night coming on had not prevented, they would not have left
a single magus alive. This day the Persians observe in common
more than any other, and in it they celebrate a great festival, which
they call "The Slaughter of the Magi." On that day no magus is
allowed to be seen in public.</p>

<p>When the tumult had subsided, and five days had elapsed, those
who had risen up against the magi deliberated on the state of affairs.
Otanes advised that they should commit the government to the
Persians at large, "for," said he, "how can a monarchy be a well-constituted
government, where one man is allowed to do whatever
he pleases without control?" Megabyzus advised them to intrust
the government to an oligarchy, and said: "Let us choose an association
of the best men, and commit the sovereign power to them,
for among them we ourselves shall be included, and it is reasonable
to expect that the best counsels will proceed from the best men."
Darius expressed his opinion the third, saying: "What Megabyzus
has said concerning the people was spoken rightly, but if
three forms are proposed, and each the best in its kind, democracy,
oligarchy, and monarchy, I contend that the last is far superior.
For nothing can be found better than one man, who is the best;
since acting upon equally wise plans, he would govern the people
without blame, and would keep his designs most secret from the
ill-affected. But in an oligarchy, whilst many are exerting their energies
for the public good, strong private enmities commonly spring
up; for each wishing to be chief, and to carry his own opinions,
they come to deep animosities one against another, whence seditions
arise; and from seditions, murder; and from murder recourse
is always had to a monarchy; and thus it is proved that this form
of government is the best. Also when the people rule, it is impossible
that evil should not spring up, and powerful combinations, for
they who injure the commonwealth act in concert; and this lasts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
until some one of the people stands forward and puts them down;
and on this account, being admired by the people, he becomes a
monarch; this again shows that a monarchy is best. Moreover,
we should not subvert the institutions of our ancestors, when we
see how good they are."</p>

<p>Four of the seven adhered to this opinion. Then said Otanes:
"Associates, since it is evident that some one of us must be made
king, I will not enter into competition with you; for I wish neither
to govern nor be governed. But on this condition I give up all
claim to the government, that neither I nor any of my posterity may
be subject to any one of you." The six agreed to these terms, and he
withdrew from the assembly; and this family alone, of all the Persians,
retains its liberty to this day, and yields obedience only so
far as it pleases, but without transgressing the laws of the Persians.
The rest of the seven consulted how they might appoint a king on
the most equitable terms; and they determined that Otanes and
his posterity forever should be given a Median vest yearly, by way
of distinction, together with all such presents as are accounted most
honorable among the Persians, for he first advised the enterprise,
and associated them together. And they made the resolution that
every one of the seven should have liberty to enter into the palace
without being introduced, and that the king should not be allowed
to marry a wife out of any other family than of the conspirators.
With regard to the kingdom, they determined that he whose horse
should first neigh in the suburbs at sunrise, while they were
mounted, should have the kingdom.</p>

<p>Darius had a groom, a shrewd man, whose name was Œbares,
to whom, when the assembly had broken up, Darius said:
"Œbares, we have determined that he whose horse shall neigh
first at sunrise, when we ourselves are mounted, is to have the
kingdom. Now, if you have any ingenuity, contrive that I may
obtain this honor, and not another." Œbares answered: "If, sir,
it depends on this, whether you shall be king or not, keep up your
spirits; for no one else shall be king before you; I know a trick
that will make him neigh." At dawn of day, the six, as they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
agreed, met together on horseback; and as they were riding round
the suburbs, Darius' horse, at the signal from Œbares, ran forward
and neighed, and at that instant lightning and thunder came from a
clear sky. These things consummated the auspices, as if done by
appointment, and the others, dismounting from their horses, did
obeisance to Darius as king.</p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly Darius, son of Hystaspes, was declared king, and
all the people of Asia, except the Arabians, were subject to him.
The Arabians never submitted to the Persian yoke, but were on
friendly terms, and gave Cambyses a free passage into Egypt; for
without the consent of the Arabians the Persians could not have
penetrated into Egypt. Darius contracted his first marriages with
Persians; he married two daughters of Cyrus, Atossa and Artystona;
Atossa, you remember, had been before married to her
brother Cambyses, and afterward to the magus. He married another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
also, daughter of Smerdis, son of Cyrus, whose name was
Parmys; and he had besides, the daughter of Otanes who detected
the magus. His power was fully established on all sides. He
erected a stone statue, representing a man on horseback; and he
had engraved on it the following inscription: "Darius, son of Hystaspes,
by the sagacity of his horse, (here mentioning the name,)
and by the address of Œbares, his groom, obtained the empire
of the Persians." In Persia, he constituted twenty governments,
which they call satrapies; set governors over them, and appointed
tributes to be paid to him from each. In consequence of this imposition
of tribute, and other things of a similar kind, the Persians
say Darius was a trader, Cambyses a master, and Cyrus a father.
The first, because he made profit of every thing; the second, because
he was severe and arrogant; the last, because he was mild, and
always aimed at the good of his people. If the total of all his revenues
is computed together, fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty
Euboic talents were collected by Darius as an annual tribute,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
passing over many small sums which I do not mention. This tribute
accrued to Darius from Asia and a small part of Libya; but in the
course of time another revenue accrued from the islands, and the
inhabitants of Europe as far as Thessaly. This treasure the king
melts and pours into earthen jars, and knocking away the earthen
mould when he wants money he cuts off as much as he has occasion
to use.</p>

<p>The Cilicians were required to send each year to Darius three
hundred and sixty white horses, one for every day. The Persian
territory alone was not subject to tribute; but the Persians brought
gifts. The Ethiopians bordering on Egypt, whom Cambyses subdued
when he marched against the Macrobian Ethiopians, and
who dwell about the sacred city of Nysa, celebrate festivals of
Bacchus, use the same grain as the Calantian Indians, and live
in subterraneous dwellings. These brought every third year two
chœnices of unmolten gold, two hundred blocks of ebony, five
Ethiopian boys, and twenty large elephants' tusks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>INDIANS, ARABIANS, AND ETHIOPIANS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> part of India toward the rising sun is all sand; for of the
people with whom we are acquainted, and of whom any thing certain
is told, the Indians live the farthest toward the east of all the
inhabitants of Asia; and the Indians' country toward the east is a
desert, by reason of the sands. There are many nations of Indians,
and they do not all speak the same language; some of them are
nomads, and they inhabit the marshes of the river, and feed on
raw fish, which they take going out in boats made of bamboo, one
joint of which makes a boat. These Indians wear a garment made
of rushes cut from the river, beaten flat, platted like a mat, and
worn as a corselet. Other Indians, living to the east of these, are
nomads, and eat raw flesh; they are called Padæans. When any
one of this community is sick, if it be a man, the men who are his
nearest connections put him to death, alleging that if he wasted by
disease his flesh would be spoiled; and no matter if he denies that he
is sick, they are not likely to agree with him, but kill and feast upon
him. And if a woman be sick, the women who are most intimate
with her do the same as the men. And whoever reaches to old
age, they sacrifice and feast upon; but few among them succeed
in growing old, for before that, every one that falls into any distemper
is put to death. Other Indians have different customs: they
neither kill any thing that has life, nor sow any thing, nor are they
wont to have houses, but they live upon herbs, and have a grain of
the size of millet, in a pod, which springs spontaneously from the
earth; this they gather, and boil and eat it with the pod. When
any one of them falls ill, he goes and lies down in the desert, and
no one takes any thought about him, whether dead or sick. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
these Indians whom I have mentioned have a complexion closely
resembling the Ethiopians. They are situated very far from the
Persians, toward the south, and were never subject to Darius.</p>

<p>Those who border on the city of Caspatyrus and the country
of Pactyica are the most warlike of the Indians, and these are they
who are sent to procure the gold. In this desert, and in the sand,
there are ants in size somewhat less indeed than dogs, but larger
than foxes. Some of them which were taken there, are in the
possession of the king of the Persians. These ants, forming their
habitations under ground, heap up the sand, as the ants in Greece
do, and in the same manner; and they are very much like them in
shape. The sand thus heaped up is mixed with gold. The
Indians go to the desert to get this sand, each man having three
camels, on either side a male harnessed to draw by the side,
and a female in the middle; this last the man mounts himself, having
taken care to yoke one that has been separated from her young
as recently born as possible; for camels are not inferior to horses
in swiftness, and are much better able to carry burdens. What
kind of figure the camel has I shall not describe to the Greeks, as
they are acquainted with it; but what is not known respecting it I
will mention. A camel has four thighs and four knees in his
hinder legs. The Indians then, adopting such a plan of harnessing,
set out for the gold, having before calculated the time, so as to be
engaged in their plunder during the hottest part of the day, for
during the heat the ants hide themselves under ground. Amongst
these people the sun is hottest in the morning, and not, as with us,
at mid-day; during this time it scorches much more than at mid-day
in Greece; so that, it is said, they then refresh themselves in
water. But as the day declines, the sun becomes to them as it is
in the morning to others; and after this, as it proceeds it becomes
still colder, until sunset, then it is very cold. When the Indians
arrive at the spot with their sacks, they fill them with the sand,
and return as fast as possible. For the ants, as the Persians say,
immediately discovering them by the smell, pursue them, and they
are equalled in swiftness by no other animal, so that if the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
did not get the start of the ants while they were assembling, not a
man of them could be saved. Now the male camels (for they are
inferior in speed to the females) would otherwise slacken their
pace, dragging on, not both equally; but the females, mindful of
the young they have left, do not slacken their pace. Thus the
Indians obtain the greatest part of their gold.</p>

</div>

<p>The extreme parts of the inhabited world somehow possess the
most excellent products; while Greece enjoys by far the best-tempered
climate. In India, the farthest part of the inhabited world
toward the east, all animals, both quadrupeds and birds, are much
larger than they are in other countries, with the exception of
horses; in this respect they are surpassed by the Medic breed
called the Nysæan horses. Then there is an abundance of gold
there, partly dug, partly brought down by the rivers,
and partly seized in the manner I have described.
And certain wild trees there bear wool instead of fruit,
which in beauty and quality excels that of sheep;
and the Indians make their clothing from these trees.
Again, Arabia is the farthest of inhabited countries
toward the south; and this is the only region in which
grow frankincense, myrrh, cassia, cinnamon, and
ledanum. All these, except myrrh, the Arabians gather with
difficulty. The frankincense they gather by burning styrax, which
the Phœnicians import into Greece. Winged serpents, small
in size, and various in form, guard the trees that bear frankincense,
a great number round each tree. These are the same
serpents that invade Egypt. They are driven from the trees
by nothing else but the smoke of the styrax. Vipers are found
in all parts of the world; but flying serpents in Arabia, and nowhere
else; there they appear to be very numerous.</p>

<p>The Arabians obtain the cassia, which grows in marshes or
shallow lakes, by covering their whole body and face, except the
eyes, with hides and skins, and thus avoiding the attacks of the
winged animals, like bats, which infest the marshes, and screech
fearfully, and are exceedingly fierce. The cinnamon they collect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
in a still more wonderful manner. Where it grows and what land
produces it they are unable to tell; except that some say it grows
in those countries in which Bacchus was nursed. Large birds
bring those rolls of bark, which we, from the Phœnicians, call cinnamon,
for their nests, which are built with clay, against precipitous
mountains, where there is no access for man. The Arabians, to
surmount this difficulty, cut up into large pieces the limbs of dead
oxen, and asses, and other beasts of burden, carry them to these
spots, lay them near the nests, and retire to a distance. The birds
fly down and carry up the limbs of the beasts to their nests, which
not being strong enough to support the weight, break and fall to
the ground. Then the men, coming up, gather the cinnamon,
much of which they export to other countries. Still more wonderful
is the fragrant ledanum. For it is found sticking like gum to
the beards of he-goats, which collect it from the wood. It is useful
for many ointments, and the Arabians burn it very generally as a
perfume. They are famous for their perfumes; and there breathes
from Arabia, as it were, a divine odor. They have two kinds of
sheep worthy of admiration, which are seen nowhere else. One
kind has large tails, not less than three cubits in length, which, if
suffered to trail, would ulcerate, by the tails rubbing on the ground.
But every shepherd knows enough of the carpenter's art to prevent
this, for they make little carts and fasten them under the tails,
binding the tail of each separate sheep to a separate cart. The
other kind of sheep have broad tails, even to a cubit in breadth.
Where the meridian declines<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>
toward the setting sun, the Ethiopian
territory extends, being the extreme part of the habitable world.
It produces much gold, huge elephants, wild trees of all kinds,
ebony, and men of large stature, very handsome, and long-lived.</p>

<p>Such are the extremities of Asia and Libya. Concerning the
western extremities of Europe I am unable to speak with certainty,
for I do not admit that there is a river, called by barbarians Eridanus,
which discharges itself into the sea toward the north, from
which amber is said to come; nor am I acquainted with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
Cassiterides Islands, whence our tin comes. For in the first
place, the name Eridanus shows that it is Grecian and not barbarian,
and coined by some poet; in the next place, though I have
diligently inquired, I have never been able to hear from any man
who has himself seen it, that there is a sea on that side of Europe.
However, both tin and amber come to us from the remotest parts.
Toward the north of Europe there is evidently a very great quantity
of gold, but how procured I am unable to say with certainty;
though it is said that the Arimaspians, a one-eyed people, steal it
from the griffins. Nor do I believe this, that any men are born
with one eye, and yet in other respects resemble the rest of mankind.
However, the extremities of the world seem to surround
and enclose the rest of the earth, and to possess those productions
which we account most excellent and rare.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>REIGN OF DARIUS TO THE TAKING OF BABYLON.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the seven men that conspired against the magus, it happened
that one of them, Intaphernes, by an act of insolence, lost
his life shortly after the revolution. He wished to enter the palace
in order to confer with Darius; but the door-keeper and the messenger
would not let him pass, saying, that the king was engaged,
but Intaphernes, suspecting they told a falsehood, drew his scimetar,
cut off their ears and noses, and having strung them to straps
taken from his bridle, hung them round their necks, and dismissed
them. They presented themselves to the king, and told him the
cause for which they had been so treated. Darius, fearing lest the
six had done this in concert, sent for them, one by one, and
endeavored to discover whether they approved of what had been
done. When he found that Intaphernes had not done this with
their knowledge, he seized Intaphernes himself, and his children,
and all his family, having many reasons to suspect that he, with his
relations, would raise a rebellion against him. And he bound them
as for death: but the wife of Intaphernes, going to the gates of
the palace, wept and lamented aloud; and prevailed on Darius to
have compassion on her. He therefore sent a messenger to say
as follows: "Madam, king Darius allows you to release one of
your relations who are now in prison, whichever of them all you
please." She deliberated, and answered: "Since the king grants
me the life of one, I choose my brother from them all." Darius,
wondering at her choice, asked: "Madam, the king inquires the
reason why, leaving your husband and children, you have chosen
that your brother should survive; who is not so near related to
you as your children, and less dear to you than your husband?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
"O king," she answered, "I may have another husband if God
will, and other children if I lose these; but as my father and
mother are no longer alive, I cannot by any means have another
brother; for this reason I spoke as I did." This pleased Darius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
so well that he granted to her the one whom she asked, and also
her eldest son; all the rest he put to death.</p>

<p class="center">ALPHABET</p>

<p class="gap-above">It happened not long after this that Darius, in leaping from his
horse while hunting, twisted his foot with such violence that the
ankle-bone was dislocated. At first thinking he had about him
Egyptians who had the first reputation for skill in the healing art,
he made use of their assistance. But they, by twisting the foot, and
using force, made the evil worse; and from the pain which he felt,
Darius lay seven days and seven nights without sleep. On the
eighth day, as he still continued in a bad state, some one who had
before heard at Sardis of the skill of Democedes the Crotonian,
made it known to Darius; and he ordered them to bring him to him
as quickly as possible. They found him among the slaves altogether
neglected; and brought him forward, dragging fetters behind him,
and clothed in rags. As he stood before him, Darius asked him
whether he understood the art. He denied that he did, fearing
lest, if he discovered himself, he should be altogether precluded from
returning to Greece. But he appeared to Darius to dissemble,
although he was skilled in the art; he therefore commanded those
who had brought him thither to bring out whips and goads.
Whereupon he owned up, saying that he did not know it perfectly,
but having been intimate with a physician, he had some poor
knowledge of the art. Upon which Darius put himself under his
care, and by using Grecian medicines, and applying lenitives after
violent remedies, he caused him to sleep, and in a little time
restored him to his health, though Darius had begun to despair of
ever recovering the use of his foot. After this cure, Darius
presented him with two pairs of golden fetters; but Democedes
asked him, if he purposely gave him a double evil because he had
restored him to health. Darius, pleased with the speech, introduced
him to his wives, with the remark that this was the man
who had saved the king's life; whereupon each of them dipped
a goblet into a chest of gold, and presented it brimful to Democedes&mdash;so
munificent a gift, that a servant named Sciton, following
behind, picked up enough staters that fell from the goblets to make
him a rich man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
This Democedes had been so harshly treated at Crotona by his
father, who was of a severe temper, that he left him and went to
Ægina; having settled there, in the first year, though he was unprovided
with means, and had none of the instruments necessary
for the exercise of his art, he surpassed the most skilful of their
physicians. In the second year, the Æginetæ engaged him for a
talent out of the public treasury; and in the third year the
Athenians, for a hundred minæ; and in the fourth year Polycrates,
for two talents; thus he came to Samos. From this man the
Crotonian physicians obtained a great reputation; for at this
period the physicians of Crotona were said to be the first throughout
Greece, and the Cyrenæans the second. At the same time the
Argives were accounted the most skilful of the Greeks in the art of
music. Democedes, having completely cured Darius at Susa, had
a very large house, and a seat at the king's table; and he had
every thing he could wish for, except the liberty of returning to
Greece. He obtained from the king a pardon for the Egyptian
physicians who first attended the king, and were about to be empaled,
because they had been outdone by a Greek physician; and
in the next place he procured the liberty of a prophet of Elis, who
had attended Polycrates, and lay neglected among the slaves. In
short, Democedes had great influence with the king.</p>

<p>Not long after Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, and wife to Darius,
had a tumor on her breast; after some time it burst, and spread
considerably. As long as it was small, she concealed it, and from
delicacy informed no one of it; when it became dangerous, she
sent for Democedes and showed it to him. He said that he could
cure her, but exacted a solemn promise, that she in return would
perform for him whatever he should require of her, but added that
he would ask nothing which might bring disgrace on her. When
therefore he had healed her, and restored her to health, Atossa, instructed
by Democedes, addressed Darius, in the following words:
"O king, you, who possess so great power, sit idle, and do not add
any nation or power to the Persians. It is right that a man who is
both young and master of such vast treasures should render himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
considerable by his actions, that the Persians may know that
they are governed by a man. Two motives should influence you,
to such a course: first, that the Persians may know that it is a
worthy man who rules over them; and secondly, that they may be
worn in war, and not tempted by too much ease to plot against
you. You must perform some illustrious action while you are in
the flower of your age; for the mind grows with the growth of the
body, and as it grows old, grows old with it, and dull for every
action." She spoke thus according to her instructions, and he answered:
"Lady, you have mentioned the very things that I myself
propose to do; for I have determined to make a bridge and
march from this continent to the other, against the Scythians; and
this shall shortly be put in execution." Atossa replied: "Give up
the thought of marching first against the Scythians, for they will
be in your power whenever you choose; but take my advice, and
lead an army into Greece; for from the account I have heard, I am
anxious to have Lacedæmonian, Argive, Athenian, and Corinthian
attendants: and you have the fittest man in the world to show and
inform you of every thing concerning Greece; I mean the person
who cured your foot." Said Darius: "Well, since you think I
ought to make my first attempt against Greece, I think it better
first to send some Persians thither as spies with the man you mention;
they, when they are informed of and have seen every particular,
will make a report to me; and then, being thoroughly informed,
I will turn my arms against them." No sooner said than
done; for as soon as day dawned, he summoned fifteen eminent
Persians, and commanded them to accompany Democedes along
the maritime parts of Greece; and to take care that Democedes
did not escape from them, but they must by all means bring him
back again. He next summoned Democedes himself, and requested
that when he should have conducted the Persians through all
Greece, and shown it to them, to return; he also commanded him
to take with him all his movables as presents to his father and
brothers, promising to give him many times as much instead.
Moreover, he said, that for the purpose of transporting the presents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
he would give a merchant-ship, filled with all kinds of precious
things, which should accompany him on his voyage. Now Darius,
in my opinion, promised him these things without any deceitful
intention; but Democedes, fearing lest Darius was making trial of
him, received all that was given, without eagerness, but said that
he would leave his own goods where they were, that he might have
them on his return; the merchant-ship he said he would accept.</p>

<p>In Sidon, a city of Phœnicia, they manned two triremes, and
with them also a large trading vessel, laden with all kinds of
precious things; and set sail for Greece. Keeping to the shore,
they surveyed the coasts, and made notes in writing; at length,
having inspected the greatest part of it, and whatever was most remarkable,
they proceeded to Tarentum in Italy. There, out of
kindness toward Democedes, Aristophilides, king of the Tarentines,
took off the rudders of the Median ships, and shut up the Persians
as spies. While they were in this condition Democedes went to
Crotona and when he had reached his own home, Aristophilides
set the Persians at liberty, and restored what he had taken from
their ships. The Persians pursuing Democedes, arrived at Crotona,
found him in the public market, and laid hands on him. Some of
the Crotonians, dreading the Persian power, were ready to deliver
him up; but others seized the Persians in turn, and beat them with
staves, though they expostulated in these terms: "Men of Crotona,
have a care what you do, you are rescuing a man who is a runaway
from the king; how will king Darius endure to be thus insulted?
How can what you do end well, if you force this man
from us? What city shall we sooner attack than this? What
sooner shall we endeavor to reduce to slavery?" But they could
not persuade the Crotonians; so launching a small boat they sailed
back to Asia; nor, as they were deprived of their guide, did they
attempt to explore Greece any further. At their departure Democedes
enjoined them to tell Darius that he had Milo's daughter
affianced to him as his wife, for the name of Milo, the wrestler,
stood high with the king; and on this account it appears to me
that Democedes spared no expense to hasten this marriage, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
might appear to Darius to be a man of consequence in his own
country.</p>

<p>After these things, king Darius took Samos, first of all the
cities, either Grecian or barbarian, and for the following reason.
When Cambyses, son of Cyrus, invaded Egypt, many Greeks resorted
thither; some, as one may conjecture, on account of trade;
others, to serve as soldiers; others, to view the country. Of these,
the last was Syloson, son of Æaces, brother to Polycrates, and an
exile from Samos. The following piece of good luck befel this
Syloson: having put on a scarlet cloak, he walked in the streets
of Memphis; and Darius, who was one of Cambyses' guard, and as
yet a man of no great account, took a fancy to the cloak, and coming
up, wished to purchase it. But Syloson, perceiving that Darius
was very anxious to have the cloak, impelled by a divine impulse,
said: "I will not sell it for any sum, but I will give it you for
nothing, if so it must needs be." Darius accepted his offer with
thanks and took the cloak. Syloson thought afterward that he had
lost it through his good nature, but when, in course of time, Cambyses
died, and the seven rose up against the magus, and of the
seven, Darius possessed the throne, Syloson heard that the kingdom
had devolved on the man to whom he had given his cloak in Egypt
on his requesting it; so he went up to Susa and seated himself at
the threshold of the king's palace, and said he had been a benefactor
to Darius. The porter reported it to the king; who said:
"What Greek is my benefactor, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude,
having so lately come to the throne? Scarcely one of them has as
yet come here; nor can I mention any thing that I owe to a Greek.
However, bring him in, that I may know the meaning of what he
says." The porter introduced Syloson, who related the story of
the cloak, and said that he was the person who gave it. "Most
generous of men!" exclaimed the king, "art thou then the man who,
when as yet I had no power, made me a present, small as it was?
yet the obligation is the same as if I were now to receive a thing
of great value. In return I will give thee abundance of gold
and silver, so that thou shalt never repent having conferred a favor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
on Darius son of Hystaspes." To this Syloson replied: "O king,
give me neither gold nor silver; but recover and give me back my
country, Samos, which now, since my brother Polycrates died by
the hands of Orœtes, a slave of ours has possessed. Give me
this without bloodshed and bondage." Then Darius sent an army
under the conduct of Otanes, one of the seven, with orders to accomplish
whatever Syloson should desire.</p>

<p>Mæandrius held the government of Samos, having had the
administration intrusted to him by Polycrates: though he wished
to prove himself the most just of men, he was unable to effect his
purpose. For when the death of Polycrates was made known to
him, he erected an altar to Jupiter Liberator, and marked round it
the sacred enclosure, which is now in the suburbs. Afterward, he
summoned an assembly of all the citizens, and said: "To me, as
you know, the sceptre and all the power of Polycrates has been intrusted,
and I am now able to retain the government. But what I
condemn in another, I will myself, to the utmost of my ability,
abstain from doing. For neither did Polycrates please me in exercising
despotic power over men equal to himself, nor would any
other who should do the like. Now Polycrates has accomplished
his fate; and I, surrendering the government into your hands, proclaim
equality to all. I require, however, that the following remuneration
should be granted to myself; that six talents should be
given me out of the treasures of Polycrates; and in addition, I
claim for myself and my descendants for ever, the priesthood of
the temple of Jupiter Liberator, to whom I have erected an altar,
and under whose auspices I restore to you your liberties." But
one of them rising up said, "You forsooth are not worthy to rule
over us, being as you are a base and pestilent fellow; rather think
how you will render an account of the wealth that you have had
the management of." Thus spoke a man of eminence among the
citizens, whose name was Telesarchus. But Mæandrius, perceiving
that if he should lay down the power, some other would set
himself up as a tyrant in his place, no longer thought of laying it
down. To which end, when he had withdrawn to the citadel, sending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
for each one severally, as if about to give an account of the
treasures, he seized them and put them in chains. They were kept
in confinement; but after this, disease attacked Mæandrius; and
his brother, whose name was Lycaretus, supposing that he would
die, in order that he might the more easily possess himself of the
government of Samos, put all the prisoners to death; for, as it
seems, they were not willing to be free.</p>

<p>When the Persians arrived at Samos, bringing Syloson with
them, no one raised a hand against them, and the partisans of
Mæandrius, and Mæandrius himself, said they were ready to quit
the island under a treaty; and when Otanes had assented to this,
and had ratified the agreement, the principal men of the Persians,
having had seats placed for them, sat down opposite the citadel.
The tyrant Mæandrius had a brother somewhat out of his senses,
whose name was Charilaus; he, for some fault he had committed,
was confined in a dungeon; and having at that time overheard what
was doing, and having peeped through his dungeon, when he saw
the Persians sitting quietly down, he shouted and said that he
wished to speak with Mæandrius. Mæandrius commanded him to
be released, and brought into his presence; and as soon as he was
brought there, upbraiding and reviling his brother, he urged him to
attack the Persians, saying: "Me, O vilest of men, who am your
own brother, and have done nothing worthy of bonds, you have
bound and adjudged to a dungeon; but when you see the Persians
driving you out and making you houseless, you dare not avenge
yourself, though they are so easy to be subdued. But if you are in
dread of them, lend me your auxiliaries, and I will punish them for
coming here, and I am ready also to send you out of the island."
Mæandrius accepted his offer, as I think, not that he had reached
such a pitch of folly as to imagine that his own power could overcome
that of the king, but rather out of envy to Syloson, if without
a struggle he should possess himself of the city uninjured. Having
therefore provoked the Persians, he wished to make the Samian
power as weak as possible, and then give it up; being well assured
that the Persians, if they suffered any ill-treatment, would be exasperated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
against the Samians; and knowing also that he himself had
a safe retreat from the island, whenever he chose, for he had had a
secret passage dug leading from the citadel to the sea. Accordingly
Mæandrius himself sailed away from Samos; but Charilaus armed
all the auxiliaries, threw open the gates, sallied out upon the Persians,
who did not expect any thing of the kind, and slew those of the
Persians who were seated in chairs, and who were the principal men
among them. But the rest of the Persian army came to their assistance,
and the auxiliaries, being hard pressed, were shut up again
within the citadel. But Otanes, the general, when he saw that the
Persians had suffered great loss, purposely neglected to obey the
orders which Darius had given him at his departure, that he should
neither kill nor take prisoner any of the Samians, but deliver the
island to Syloson without damage; on the contrary, he commanded
his army to put to death every one they met with, both man and
child alike. Whereupon, one part of the army besieged the citadel,
and the rest killed every one that came in their way, all they
met, as well within the temples as without. Mæandrius in the meantime
sailed to Lacedæmon, and carried with him all his treasures.
One day when he had set out his silver and golden cups, his servants
began to clean them; and he, at the same time, holding a
conversation with Cleomenes, son of Anaxandrides, then king of
Sparta, led him on to his house. When the king saw the cups, he
was struck with wonder and astonishment; upon which Mæandrius
bade him take whatever he pleased, and when Mæandrius had repeated
this offer two or three times, Cleomenes showed himself a
man of the highest integrity, for he refused to accept what was offered;
and being informed that by giving to other citizens he would
gain their support, he went to the Ephori, and said that it would be
better for Sparta that this Samian stranger should quit the Peloponnesus,
lest he should persuade him or some other of the Spartans
to become base. They immediately banished Mæandrius by public
proclamation. The Persians, having drawn Samos as with a net,
delivered it to Syloson, utterly destitute of inhabitants. Afterward,
however, Otanes, the general, repeopled it, in consequence of a
vision in a dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
Whilst the naval armament was on its way to Samos, the Babylonians
revolted, having very well prepared themselves. For during
all the time the magus reigned, and the seven were rising up
against him, they had made preparations for a siege, and somehow
in the confusion this had escaped observation. But when they openly
revolted they resorted to this extraordinary means of husbanding
their resources: gathering together all the women, except their
mothers, and one woman apiece, besides, whom each one chose from
his own family, they strangled them; the one woman each man selected
to cook his food, and they strangled the rest, that they might
not consume their provisions. When Darius was informed of this,
he collected all his forces, and marched against Babylon. But upon
laying siege to them he found that they were not at all solicitous
about the event, for the Babylonians mounted the ramparts, and
danced, and derided Darius and his army, and cried: "Why sit ye
there, Persians? will ye not be off? It will be a long day before
you will take us."</p>

<p>When the nineteenth month of the siege had passed, Zopyrus,
son of that Megabyzus, who was one of the seven who dethroned
the magus, went to Darius and asked him whether he deemed the
taking of Babylon of very great importance. Learning that he
valued it at a high price, he went away and inflicted on himself
an irremediable mutilation, for he cut off his nose and ears, chopped
his hair in a disgraceful manner, scourged himself, and then presented
himself before Darius. The latter was very much grieved
when he beheld a man of high rank so mutilated, and starting from
his throne, he shouted aloud and asked who had mutilated him,
and for what cause. He answered: "O King, there is no man
except yourself who could have power to treat me thus; no
stranger has done it, but I myself, deeming it a great indignity
that the Assyrians should deride the Persians." "Foolish man,"
said Darius, "because you are mutilated, will the enemy sooner
submit? Have you lost your senses, that you have thus ruined
yourself?" "If I had communicated to you what I was about to
do," he answered, "you would not have permitted me, but now, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
you are not wanting to your own interests, we shall take Babylon.
For I, as I am, will desert to the city, and will tell them that I have
been thus treated by you; and I think that when I have persuaded
them that such is the case, I shall obtain the command of their
army. Do you then, on the tenth day after I shall have entered
the city, station a thousand men of that part of your army whose
loss you would least regret over against the gates called after
Semiramis; again, on the seventh day after the tenth, station two
thousand more against the gate called from Nineveh; and from
the seventh day let an interval of twenty days elapse, and then
place four thousand more against the gate called from the Chaldæans;
but let them carry no defensive arms except swords.
After the twentieth day, command the rest of the army to invest
the wall on all sides, but station the Persians for me at those called
the Belidian and Cissian gates; for, as I think, when I have performed
great exploits, the Babylonians will intrust every thing to
me, and, moreover, the keys of the gates, and then it will be mine
and the Persians' care to do what remains to be done."</p>

</div>

<p>Having given these injunctions, he went to the gates, turning
round as if he were really a deserter. Those who were stationed
in that quarter, seeing him from the turrets, ran down and opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
one door of the gate a little, and asked him who he was, and for
what purpose he came. He told them that he was Zopyrus, and
had deserted to them: the door-keepers then conducted him to
the assembly of the Babylonians, and standing before them he deplored
his condition, saying that he had suffered from Darius these
injuries, and that he was so treated because he had advised to raise
the siege, since there appeared no means of taking the city.
"Now, therefore," he said, "I come to you, O Babylonians, as
your greatest blessing; and to Darius, his army, and the Persians,
the greatest mischief; for he shall not escape with impunity,
having thus mutilated me; and I am acquainted with all his
designs." And the Babylonians, seeing a man of distinction
among the Persians deprived of his ears and nose, and covered
with stripes and blood, thoroughly believing that he spoke the
truth, and that he had come as an ally to them, were ready to intrust
him with whatever he should ask; and he, having obtained
the command of the forces, acted as he had preconcerted with
Darius; for on the tenth he led out the army of the Babylonians,
and surrounded the thousand whom he had instructed Darius to
station there, and cut them all in pieces. Then the Babylonians,
perceiving that he performed deeds such as he promised, were
ready to obey him in every thing. He then suffered the appointed
number of days to elapse, and again selected a body of Babylonians,
led them out, and slaughtered the two thousand of Darius'
soldiers. The Babylonians witnessing this action also, all had the
praises of Zopyrus on their tongues. Then he again, after the
appointed number of days had elapsed, led out his troops according
to the settled plan, surrounded the four thousand, and cut them in
pieces. And when he had accomplished this, Zopyrus was every
thing to the Babylonians, and was appointed commander-in-chief
and guardian of the walls. But when Darius, according to agreement,
invested the wall all round, then Zopyrus discovered his
whole treachery; for while the Babylonians, mounting the wall,
repelled the army of Darius that was attacking them, Zopyrus
opened the Cissian and Belidian gates and led the Persians within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
the wall. Those of the Babylonians who saw what was done, fled
into the temple of Jupiter Belus; and those who did not see it, remained
each at his post, until they also discovered that they had
been betrayed.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Thus Babylon was taken a second time. But when Darius had
made himself master of the Babylonians, first of all, he demolished
the walls and bore away all the
gates, for when Cyrus had taken
Babylon before, he did neither
of these things; and secondly,
Darius impaled about three thousand
of the principal citizens, and
allowed the rest of the Babylonians
to inhabit the city. And that
the Babylonians might have
wives to take the place of those
they had strangled, Darius ordered
the neighboring provinces to
send women to Babylon, taxing
each at a certain number, so that
a total of fifty thousand women came together; and from these the
Babylonians of our time are descended. No Persian, in the opinion
of Darius, either of those who came after, or who lived before, surpassed
Zopyrus in great achievements, Cyrus only excepted; for with
him no Persian ever ventured to compare himself. It is also reported
that Darius frequently expressed this opinion, that he would rather
Zopyrus had not suffered such ignominious treatment than acquire
twenty Babylons in addition to that he had. And he honored him
exceedingly; for he every year presented him with those gifts
which are most prized by the Persians, and he assigned him Babylon
to hold free from taxes during his life.</p>

<h2><i>BOOK IV. MELPOMENE.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>DESCRIPTION OF SCYTHIA AND THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the capture of Babylon, Darius made an expedition
against the Scythians, for as Asia was flourishing in men, and
large revenues came in, Darius was desirous of revenging himself
upon the Scythians, because they had formerly invaded the Median
territory, and defeated in battle those that opposed them. For the
Scythians ruled over Upper Asia for twenty-eight years. But
when those Scythians returned to their own country, after such an
interval, a task no less than the invasion of Media awaited them;
for they found an army of no inconsiderable force ready to oppose
them; the wives of the Scythians, seeing their husbands were a
long time absent, had married their slaves. The Scythians deprive
all their slaves of sight for the sake of the milk which they drink,
doing as follows: when they have taken bone tubes very like
flutes, they thrust them into the veins of the mares, and blow with
their mouth; while some blow, others milk. They say they do
this because the veins of the mare, being inflated, become filled,
and the udder is depressed. When they have finished milking,
they pour the milk into hollow wooden vessels, and having placed
the blind men round about the vessels, they agitate the milk: then
they skim off that which swims on the surface, considering it the
most valuable, but that which subsides is of less value than the
other. On this account the Scythians put out the eyes of every
prisoner they take; for they are not agriculturists, but feeders of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
cattle. From these slaves then and the women a race of youths
had grown up, who, when they knew their own extraction, opposed
those who were returning from Media. And first they cut off the
country by digging a wide ditch, stretching from Mount Taurus to
the lake Mæotis, which is of great extent, and afterward encamping
opposite, they came to an engagement with the Scythians, who were
endeavoring to enter. When several battles had been fought, and
the Scythians were unable to obtain any advantage, one of them
said: "Men of Scythia, what are we doing? by fighting with our
slaves not only are we ourselves by being slain becoming fewer in
number, but by killing them we shall hereafter have fewer to rule
over. So it seems to me that we should lay aside our spears and
bows, and that every one, taking a horsewhip, should go directly
to them; for so long as they saw us with arms, they considered
themselves equal to us, and born of equal birth; but when they
shall see us with our whips instead of arms, they will soon learn
that they are our slaves, and will no longer resist." The Scythians
adopted the advice on the spot; and the slaves, struck with astonishment,
forgot to fight, and fled.</p>

<p>As the Scythians say, theirs is the most recent of all nations.
The first man that appeared in this country, which was a wilderness,
was named Targitaus; they say that the parents of this Targitaus,
in my opinion relating what is incredible, were Jupiter and
a daughter of the river Borysthenes; and that Targitaus had three
sons, who went by the names of Lipoxais, Apovais, and Colaxais;
that during their reign a plough, a yoke, an axe, and a bowl of
golden workmanship, dropping down from heaven, fell on the
Scythian territory; that the eldest, seeing them first, approached,
intending to take them up, but as he came near, the gold began to
burn; when he had retired the second went up, and it did the
same again; but when the youngest approached, the burning
gold became extinguished, and he carried the things home
with him; and the elder brothers, in consequence of this, giving
way, surrendered the whole authority to Alaxais the youngest.
The Scythians reckon the whole number of years from their beginning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
from King Targitaus to the time that Darius crossed over
against them, to be just a thousand years. This sacred gold the
kings watch with the greatest care, and annually approach it with
magnificent sacrifices to render it propitious. If he who has the
sacred gold happens to fall asleep in the open air on the festival,
the Scythians say he cannot survive the year, and on this account
they give him as much land as he can ride round on horseback in
one day. The country being very extensive, Colaxais established
three of the kingdoms for his sons, and made that one the largest
in which the gold is kept. The parts beyond the north of the
inhabited districts the Scythians say can neither be seen nor passed
through, by reason of the feathers shed there; for the earth and
air are so full of feathers that the view is intercepted. With
respect to these feathers I entertain the following opinion: in the
upper parts of this country it continually snows, less in summer
than in winter, as is reasonable; now, whoever has seen snow
falling thick near him, will know what I mean; for snow is like
feathers; and on account of the winter being so severe, the northern
parts of this continent are uninhabited.</p>

<p>Such is the account the Scythians give of themselves, and of
the country above them; but the Greeks who inhabit Pontus give
the following account: they say that Hercules, as he was driving
away the herds of Geryon, arrived in this country, which was then
a desert, and that Geryon, fixing his abode outside the Pontus,
inhabited the island which the Greeks call Erythia, situated near
Gades, beyond the columns of Hercules in the ocean. The ocean,
they say, beginning from the sunrise, flows round the whole earth,
that Hercules thence came to the country now called Scythia, and
as a storm and frost overtook him, he drew his lion's skin over
him, and went to sleep; and in the meanwhile, his mares, which
were feeding apart from his chariot, vanished by some divine
chance. They add that when Hercules awoke, he sought for
them; and that having gone over the whole country, he at length
came to the land called Hylæa; there he found a monster, having
two natures, half virgin, half viper, of which the upper parts resembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
a woman, and the lower parts a serpent: in astonishment he
asked her if she had anywhere seen his strayed mares. She said
that she herself had them, and would not restore them to him
unless he would make her his wife. Hercules agreed. She, however,
delayed giving back the mares, out of a desire to detain Hercules
as long as she could; but as he was desirous of recovering
them and departing, she at last restored the mares, saying:
"These mares that strayed hither I preserved for you, but
now that you will go away and leave me, tell me what I
must do with our three sons when they are grown up; shall
I establish them here, for I possess the rule over this country,
or shall I send them to you?" He replied: "When you
see the children arrived at the age of men, you cannot err if you
do this: whichever of them you see able thus to bend this bow,
and thus girding himself with this girdle, make him an inhabitant
of this country; and whichever fails in these tasks which I
enjoin, send out of the country. If you do this you will please
yourself and do wisely." Then having drawn out one of his bows,
for Hercules carried two at that time, and having shown her the
belt, he gave her both the bow and the belt, which had a golden
cup at the extremity of the clasp, and departed. When the sons
had attained to the age of men she gave them names; to the first,
Agathyrsis, to the second, Gelonus, and to the youngest, Scythes;
and, in the next place, she did what had been enjoined; and two
of her sons, Agathyrsis and Gelonus, being unable to come up to
the proposed task, left the country, being expelled by their mother;
but the youngest of them, Scythes, having accomplished it, remained
there. From this Scythes, son of Hercules, are descended
those who have been successively kings of the Scythians; and
from the cup, the Scythians even to this day wear cups hung from
their belts.</p>

<p>Aristeas, of Proconnesus, says in his epic verses, that, inspired
by Apollo, he came to the Issedones; that beyond the Issedones
dwell the Arimaspians, a people that have only one eye; beyond
them the gold-guarding griffins; and beyond these the Hyperboreans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
who reach to the sea: that all these, except the Hyperboreans,
beginning from the Arimaspians, continually encroached
upon their neighbors; that the Issedones were expelled from their
country by the Arimaspians, the Scythians by the Issedones, and
that the Cimmerians, who inhabited on the South Sea, being pressed
by the Scythians, abandoned their country.</p>

<p>No one knows with certainty what is beyond the country about
which this account speaks. But as far as we have been able to arrive
at the truth with accuracy from hearsay, the whole shall be related.
From the port of the Borysthenitæ, for this is the most central part
of the sea-coast of all Scythia, the first people are the Callipidæ,
being Greek-Scythians; beyond these is another nation called Alazones.
These and the Callipidæ, in other respects, follow the usages,
of the Scythians, but they both sow and feed on wheat, onions, garlic,
lentils, and millet; but beyond the Alazones dwell husbandmen,
who do not sow wheat for food but for sale. Beyond these the
Neuri dwell; and to the north of the Neuri the country is utterly
uninhabited, as far as I know. These nations are by the side of
the river Hypanis, to the west of the Borysthenes. But if one
crosses the Borysthenes, the first country from the sea is Hylæa;
and from this higher up live Scythian agriculturists, where the
Greeks settled on the river Hypanis. These Scythian husbandmen
occupy the country eastward, for three days' journey, extending
to the river whose name is Panticapes; and northward a passage
of eleven days up the Borysthenes. Beyond this region
the country is a desert for a great distance; and beyond the
desert Androphagi dwell, who are a distinct people, not in any respect
Scythian. Beyond this is really desert, and no nation of
men is found there, as far as we know. The country eastward of
these Scythian agriculturists, when one crosses the river Panticapes,
nomads occupy, who neither sow at all nor plough; and all this
country is destitute of trees except Hylæa. The nomads occupy
a tract eastward for fourteen days' journey, stretching to the river
Gerrhus. Beyond the Gerrhus are the parts called the Royal, and
the most valiant and numerous of the Scythians, who deem all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
other Scythians to be their slaves. These extend southward to
Taurica, and eastward to the trench, which those sprung from the
blind men dug, and to the port on the lake Mæotis, which is called
Cremni, and some of them reach to the river Tanais. The parts
above to the north of the Royal Scythians, the Melanchlæni inhabit,
a distinct race, and not Scythian. But above the Melanchlæni
are lakes, and an uninhabited desert, as far as we know.</p>

<p>After one crosses the river Tanais, it is no longer Scythian, but
the first region belongs to the Sauromatæ, who, beginning from
the recess of the lake Mæotis, occupy the country northward, for
a fifteen days' journey, all destitute both of wild and cultivated
trees. Above these dwell the Budini, occupying the second region,
and possessing a country thickly covered with all sorts of
trees. Above the Budini, toward the north, there is first a desert
of seven days' journey, and next to the desert, if one turns somewhat
toward the east, dwell the Thyssagetæ, a numerous and distinct
race, and they live by hunting. Contiguous to these, in the
same regions, dwell those who are called Iyrcæ, who also live by
hunting in the following manner: the huntsman, having climbed a
tree, lies in ambush (and the whole country is thickly wooded),
and each man has a horse ready taught to lie on his belly, that he
may not be much above the ground, and a dog besides. When
he sees any game from the tree, having let fly an arrow, he mounts
his horse, and goes in pursuit, and the dog keeps close to him.
Above these, as one bends toward the east, dwell other Scythians,
who revolted from the Royal Scythians, and so came to this
country. As far as the territory of these Scythians, the whole
country that has been described is level and deep-soiled; but after
this it is stony and rugged. When one has passed through
a considerable extent of the rugged country, a people are found
living at the foot of lofty mountains, who are said to be all bald
from their birth, both men and women, and are flat-nosed, and have
large chins; they speak a peculiar language, wear the Scythian
costume, and live on the fruit of a tree; the name of the tree on
which they live is called ponticon, and is about the size of a figtree;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
it bears fruit like a bean, and has a stone. When this is
ripe they strain it through a cloth, and a thick and black liquor
flows from it, to which they give the name of aschy; this they suck,
and drink mingled with milk; from the thick sediment of the pulp
they make cakes to eat, for they have not many cattle in these
parts, as the pastures there are not good. Every man lives under
a tree, which, in the winter, he covers with a thick white woollen
covering. No man does any injury to this people, for they are
accounted sacred; nor do they possess any warlike weapon.
They determine by arbitration the differences that arise among
their neighbors; and whoever takes refuge among them is injured
by no one. They are called Argippæi.</p>

<p>As far, then, as these bald people, our knowledge respecting
the country and the nations before them is very good, for some
Scythians frequently go there from whom it is not difficult to obtain
information, as well as some Greeks belonging to the ports in
Pontus. The Scythians who go to them transact business by
means of seven interpreters and seven languages, but beyond the
bald men no one can speak with certainty, for lofty and impassable
mountains form their boundary, which no one has ever crossed;
but these bald men say, what to me is incredible, that men with
goats' feet inhabit these mountains; and when one has passed beyond
them, other men are found, who sleep six months at a time,
but this I do not at all admit. However, the country eastward of
the bald men is well known, being inhabited by Issedones, who
are said to observe this extraordinary custom. When a man's
father dies all his relations bring cattle, which they sacrifice, and,
having cut up the flesh, they cut up also the dead parent of their
host, and mingling all the flesh together, they spread out a banquet;
then making bare and cleansing his head they gild it; and
afterward treat it as a sacred image, performing grand annual sacrifices
to it. A son does this to his father, as the Greeks celebrate
the anniversary of their father's death. These people are likewise
accounted just; and the women have equal authority with the
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
Above them, the Issedones affirm, are the men with only one
eye, and the gold-guarding griffins. The Scythians repeat this
account, having received it from them; and we have adopted it
from the Scythians, and call them in the Scythian language, Arimaspi;
for <i>Arima</i>, in the Scythian language, signifies one, and
<i>Spou</i>, the eye. All this country which I have been speaking of is
subject to such a severe winter, that for eight months the frost is
intolerable, so that if you pour water on the ground you will not
make mud, but if you light a fire you will. Even the sea freezes,
and the whole Cimmerian Bosphorus; and the Scythians who live
within the trench lead their armies and drive their chariots over
the ice to the Sindians, on the other side. Thus winter continues
eight months, and even during the other four it is cold there.
And this winter is different in character from the winters in all
other countries; for in this no rain worth mentioning falls in the
usual season, but during the summer it never leaves off raining.
At the time when there is thunder elsewhere there is none there,
but in summer it is violent: if there should be thunder in winter,
it is counted a prodigy to be wondered at. So, should there be
an earthquake, whether in summer or winter, in Scythia it is accounted
a prodigy. Their horses endure this cold, but asses and
mules cannot endure it at all; whereas in other places in the world
horses that stand exposed to frost become frost-bitten and waste
away, but asses and mules endure it. On this account also the
race of beeves appears to me to be defective there, and not to have
horns; and the following verse of Homer, in his Odyssey, confirms
my opinion: "And Libya, where the lambs soon put forth their
horns," rightly observing, that in warm climates horns shoot out
quickly; but in very severe cold, the cattle do not produce them
at all, or with difficulty. Concerning the Hyperboreans, I do not
relate the story of Abaris, who was said to have carried an arrow
round the whole earth without eating any thing. But I smile
when I see many persons describing the circumference of the earth,
who have no sound reason to guide them; they describe the ocean
as flowing around the earth, which is made circular as if by a lathe,
and make Asia equal to Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
In length Europe extends along both Libya and Asia, but in
respect to width, it is evidently much larger. Libya shows itself
to be surrounded by water, except so much of it as borders upon
Asia. Neco, King of Egypt, was the first whom we know of that
proved this; when he had ceased digging the canal leading from
the Nile to the Arabian Gulf, he sent certain Phœnicians in ships,
with orders to sail back through the pillars of Hercules into the
Mediterranean Sea, and so return to Egypt. The Phœnicians accordingly,
setting out from the Red Sea, navigated the southern
sea; when autumn came they went ashore and sowed the land, by
whatever part of Libya they happened to be sailing, and waited
for harvest; then having reaped the corn, they put to sea again.
When two years had thus passed, in the third they doubled the
pillars of Hercules, arrived in Egypt, and related what to me does
not seem credible, but may to others, that as they sailed round
Libya, they had the sun on their right hand.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
Ever since that the Carthaginians say that Libya is surrounded by water.</p>

<p>A great part of Asia was explored under the direction of
Darius. Being desirous to know where the Indus, which is the
second river that produces crocodiles, discharges itself into the sea,
he sent in ships Scylax of Caryanda and others on whom he could
rely to make a true report. They accordingly set out from the
city of Caspatyrus, sailed down the river toward the sunrise to the
sea; then sailing on the sea westward, they arrived in the thirtieth
month at that place where the king of Egypt despatched the
Phœnicians, whom I before mentioned, to sail round Libya. After
this Darius subdued the Indians, and frequented this sea. Thus
the other parts of Asia, except toward the rising sun, are found to
exhibit things similar to Libya.</p>

<p>Whether Europe is surrounded by water either toward the east
or toward the north, has not been fully discovered by any man;
but in length it is known to extend beyond both the other continents.
Nor can I conjecture for what reason three different names
have been given to the earth, which is but one, and why those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
should be derived from the names of women, Libya is said by
most of the Greeks to take its name from a native woman of the
name of Libya; and Asia, from the wife of Prometheus. But the
Lydians claim this name, saying that Asia was so called after
Asius, son of Cotys, son of Manes, and not after Asia the wife of
Prometheus; from whom also a tribe in Sardis is called the Asian
tribe; nor is it clear whence Europe received its name, nor who
gave it, unless we say that the region received the name from the
Tyrian Europa: yet she evidently belonged to Asia, and never
came into the country which is now called Europe by the Greeks.</p>

<p>The Euxine Sea exhibits the most ignorant nations: for we are
unable to mention any one nation of those on this side the Pontus
that has any pretensions to intelligence; nor have we ever heard
of any learned man among them, except the Scythian nation and
Anacharsis. By the Scythian nation one of the most important of
human devices has been contrived more wisely than by any others
whom we know; their other customs, however, I do not admire.
This device has been contrived so that no one who attacks them
can escape; and that, if they do not choose to be found, no one is
able to overtake them. For they have neither cities nor fortifications,
but carry their houses with them; they are all equestrian
archers, living not from the cultivation of the earth, but from
cattle, and their dwellings are wagons,&mdash;how must not such a
people be invincible, and difficult to engage with? The country
and the rivers aid them: for the country, being level, abounds in
herbage and is well watered; and rivers flow through it almost as
numerous as the canals in Egypt. The Ister, which is the greatest
of all the rivers we know, flows always with an equal stream
both in summer and winter, and has five mouths.</p>

<p>In each district of the Scythians, in the place where the magistrates
assemble, is erected a structure sacred to Mars, of the following
kind. Bundles of faggots are heaped up to the length and
breadth of three stades, but less in height; on the top of this a
square platform is formed; and three of the sides are perpendicular,
but on the fourth it is accessible. Every year they heap on it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
one hundred and fifty wagon-loads of faggots, for it is continually
sinking by reason of the weather. On this heap an old iron
scimetar is placed by each tribe, and this is the image of Mars;
they bring yearly sacrifices of cattle and horses; and to these
<i>scimetars</i> they offer more sacrifices than to the rest of the gods.
Whatever enemies they take alive, of these they sacrifice one in a
hundred, not in the same manner as they do the cattle, but in a
different manner; for after they have poured a libation of wine on
their heads, they cut the throats of the men over a bowl; then
having carried <i>the bowl</i> on the heap of faggots, they pour the blood
over the scimetar. Below at the sacred precinct, they do as follows:
having cut off all the right shoulders of the men that have
been killed, with the arms, they throw them into the air; and then,
having finished the rest of the sacrificial rites, they depart; but
the arm lies wherever it has fallen, and the body apart. Swine
they never use, nor suffer them to be used in their country at all.</p>

<p>When a Scythian overthrows his first enemy, he drinks his
blood; and presents the king with the heads of the enemies he
has killed in battle; for if he brings a head, he shares the booty
that they take; but not, if he does not bring one. He skins it in
the following manner. Having made a circular incision round the
ears and taking hold of the skin, he shakes it from the skull; then
having scraped off the flesh with the rib of an ox, he softens the
skin with his hands, makes it supple, and uses it as a napkin; each
man hangs it on the bridle of the horse which he rides, and prides
himself on it; for whoever has the greatest number of these skin
napkins is accounted the most valiant man. Many of them make
cloaks of these skins, to throw over themselves, sewing them
together like shepherd's coats; and many, having flayed the right
hands of their enemies that are dead, together with the nails, make
coverings for their quivers; the skin of a man, which is both thick
and shining, surpasses almost all other skins in the brightness of
its white. Many, having flayed men whole, and stretched the skin
on wood, carry it about on horseback. The heads themselves, not
indeed of all, but of their greatest enemies, they treat as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
each, having sawn off all below the eye-brows, cleanses it, and if
the man is poor, he covers only the outside with leather, and so
uses it; but if he is rich, he covers it with leather, and gilds the
inside, and so uses it for a drinking-cup. They do this also to
their relatives, if they are at variance, and one prevails over
another in the presence of the king. When strangers of consideration
come to him, he produces these heads, and relates how,
though they were his relatives, they made war against him, and he
overcame them, considering this a proof of bravery. Once in
every year, the governor of a district, each in his own district,
mingles a bowl of wine, from which those Scythians drink by
whom enemies have been captured; but they who have not
achieved this, do not taste of this wine, but sit at a distance in dishonor;
this is accounted the greatest disgrace: such of them as
have killed very many men, having two cups at once, drink them
together.</p>

<p>Soothsayers among the Scythians are numerous, who divine by
the help of a number of willow rods, in the following manner.
They lay large bundles of twigs on the ground and untie them;
and having placed each rod apart, they utter their predictions;
and whilst they are pronouncing them, they gather up the rods
again, and put them together again one by one. This is their
national mode of divination. But the Enarees, or Androgyni, say
that Venus gave them the power of divining by means of the bark
of a linden tree: when a man has split the linden-tree in three
pieces, twisting it round his own fingers, and then untwisting it,
he utters a response.</p>

<p>When the king of the Scythians is sick, he sends for three of
the most famous of the prophets, who prophesy in the manner
above mentioned. When any of these prophets are proved to
have sworn falsely, they put them to death in the following
manner: they fill a wagon with faggots, and yoke oxen to it, then
tie the feet of the prophets, bind their hands behind them, gag
them, and enclose them in the midst of the faggots; then having
set fire to them, they terrify the oxen, and let them go. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
oxen are burnt with the prophets, and many escape very much
scorched, when the pole has been burnt asunder. Of the children
of those whom he puts to death, the king kills all the males, but
does not hurt the females.</p>

<p>The sepulchres of the kings are in the country of the Gerrhi.
There, when their king dies, they dig a large square hole in the
ground, to receive the corpse. Then, having the body covered
with wax, the belly opened and cleaned, filled with bruised cypress,
incense, parsley and anise-seed, and sewn up again, they carry it
in a chariot to another nation; those who receive the corpse,
brought to them, do the same as the Royal Scythians; they cut
off part of their ear, shave off their hair, wound themselves on the
arms, lacerate their forehead and nose, and drive arrows through
their left hand. Thence they carry the corpse of the king to
another nation whom they govern; and those to whom they first
came accompany them. When they have carried the corpse
round all the provinces, they arrive at the sepulchres among the
Gerrhi, who are the most remote of the nations they rule over.
Then, when they have placed the corpse in the grave on a bed of
leaves, having fixed spears on each side of the dead body, they lay
pieces of wood over it, and cover it over with mats. In the remaining
space of the grave they bury one of the king's wives,
having strangled her, and his cup-bearer, a cook, a groom, a page,
a courier, and horses, and firstlings of everything else, and golden
goblets; they make no use of silver or bronze. Then they all
heap up a large mound, vieing with each other to make it as large
as possible. At the expiration of a year, they take the most fitting
of his remaining servants, all native Scythians; for whomsoever
the king may order serve him, and they have no servants bought
with money. Now when they have strangled fifty of these
servants, and fifty of the finest horses, they take out their bowels,
cleanse them, fill them with chaff, and sew them up again. Then
placing the half of a wheel, with its concave side uppermost,
on two pieces of wood, and the other half on two other pieces
of wood, and preparing many of these in the same manner, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
thrust thick pieces of wood through the horses lengthwise, up to
the neck, mount them on the half-wheels; the foremost part of
the half-wheels supporting the shoulders of the horses, and the
hinder part the belly near the thighs, while the legs on both sides
are suspended in the air; then, having put bridles and bits on the
horses, they stretch them in front, and fasten them to a stake;
they then mount upon each horse one of the fifty young men that
have been strangled. They drive a straight piece of wood along
the spine as far as the neck, and a part of this wood which projects
from the bottom they fix into a hole bored in the other piece
of wood that passes through the horse. The horsemen are then
placed round the monument, and they depart.</p>

<p>When the other Scythians die, their nearest relations carry
them about among their friends, laid in chariots; each one receives
and entertains the attendants, and sets the same things before the
dead body, as before the rest. In this manner private persons are
carried about for forty days, and then buried. After the burial the
Scythians purify themselves by wiping and thoroughly washing
their heads and bodies. They set up three pieces of wood leaning
against each other, extend around them woollen cloths; and having
joined them together as closely as possible, they throw red-hot
stones into a vessel placed in the middle of the pieces of wood and
the cloths. They have a sort of hemp growing in this country,
much like flax, except in thickness and height; in this respect the
hemp is far superior: it grows both spontaneously and from cultivation;
and from it the Thracians make garments like linen, nor
would any one who is not well skilled in such matters distinguish
whether they are made of flax or hemp, but a person who has never
seen this hemp would think the garment was made of flax. The
Scythians take seed of this hemp, creep under the cloths, and put
the seed on the red-hot stones; this smokes, and produces
such a steam, as no Grecian vapor-bath could surpass. Transported
with vapor, they shout aloud; and this serves them instead
of washing, for they never bathe the body in water. Their women
pound on a rough stone pieces of cypress, cedar, and incense-tree,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
pouring on water; and then this pounded matter, when it is thick,
they smear over the whole body and face. This at the same time
gives them an agreeable odor, and when they take off the cataplasm
on the following day, they become clean and shining.</p>

<p>I have never been able to learn with accuracy the amount
of the population of the Scythians. There is a spot between
the river Borysthenes and the Hypanis, called Exampæus, containing
a fountain of bitter water, which renders the Hypanis unfit to
be drunk. In this spot lies a bronze cauldron, in size six times as
large as the bowl at the mouth of the Pontus, which Pausanias, son
of Cleombrotus, dedicated. For the benefit of any one who has
never seen this, I will describe it: The cauldron easily contains six
hundred amphoræ; and is six fingers in thickness. The inhabitants
say that it was made from the points of arrows; for their king,
Ariantas, wishing to know the population of the Scythians, commanded
the Scythians to bring him each one point of an arrow,
and threatened death on whosoever should fail to bring it.
Accordingly, a vast number of arrow points were brought, and resolving
to leave a monument made from them, he made this bronze
bowl, and dedicated it at Exampæus. Their country has nothing
wonderful, except the rivers, which are very large and very many
in number, and the extensive plains. They show the print
of the foot of Hercules upon a rock near the river Tyras; it
resembles the footstep of man, and is two cubits in length.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>INVASION OF SCYTHIA BY DARIUS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> Darius was making preparations against the Scythians,
and sending messages to command some to contribute land forces,
and others a fleet, and others to bridge over the Thracian Bosphorus,
Artabanus, the son of Hystaspes, and brother of Darius,
entreated him on no account to make an expedition against the
Scythians, representing the poverty of Scythia; but he could not
persuade him. At that time Œobazus, a Persian, who had three
sons all serving in the army, besought Darius that one might be
left at home for him. The king answered him, as a friend, and
one who had made a moderate request, that he would leave him
all his sons; he therefore was exceedingly delighted, hoping that
his sons would be discharged from the army. But at Darius' command
the proper officers put all the sons of Œobazus to death, and
left them on the spot.</p>

<p>When Darius, marching from Susa, reached Chalcedon on the
Bosphorus, a bridge was already laid across. There, sitting in the
temple, he took a view of the Euxine Sea, which is worthy of admiration,
for of all seas it is by nature the most wonderful.</p>

<p>Darius, pleased with the bridge, presented its architect, Mandrocles
the Samian, with ten of every thing, and he painted a
picture of the whole junction of the Bosphorus, with King Darius
seated on a throne, and his army crossing over, and dedicated it
as first fruits in the temple of Juno.</p>

<p>When Darius reached the river Tearus he was so delighted
with it that he erected a pillar with this inscription: <span class="smcap">The springs
of the Tearus yield the best and finest water of all rivers;
and a man, the best and finest of all men, came to them, leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
an army against the scythians, darius, son of hystaspes,
king of the persians, and of the whole continent.</span></p>

<p>Before he reached the Ister, he subdued the Getæ, who think
themselves immortal, supposing that they themselves do not die,
but that the deceased go to the deity Zalmoxis. Every fifth year
they dispatch one of themselves, taken by lot, to Zalmoxis, with
orders to let him know on each occasion what they want. Their
mode of sending him is this. Some who are appointed hold three
javelins; whilst others take up the man who is to be sent to Zalmoxis
by the hands and feet, swing him round, and throw him into
the air, upon the points. If he is transfixed and dies, they think
the god is propitious to them; if he does not die, they blame the
messenger himself, saying that he is a bad man, and dispatch another.</p>

<p>When Darius and his land forces reached the Ister and all had
crossed, Coes, general of the Mitylenians, advised the king to let
the bridge remain over it, leaving the men who constructed it as
its guard. "Not," said he, "that I am at all afraid that we shall be
conquered in battle by the Scythians, but rather that, being unable
to find them, we may suffer somewhat in our wanderings."
"Lesbian friend," replied Darius, "when I am safe back in my
own palace, fail not to present yourself to me, that I may requite
you for good advice with good deeds." Tying sixty knots in a
thong, he summoned the Ionian commanders to his presence, and
said: "Men of Ionia, I have changed my resolution concerning
the bridge; so take this thong, and as soon as you see me
march against the Scythians, untie one of these knots every day;
and if I return not until the days numbered by the knots have
passed, sail away to your own country. Till that time, since I
have changed my determination, guard the bridge, and apply the
utmost care to preserve and secure it."</p>

<p>The Scythians determined to fight no battle in the open field,
because their allies did not come to their assistance; but to retreat
and draw off covertly, and fill up the wells and the springs as
they passed by, and destroy the herbage on the ground. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
sent forward the best of their cavalry as an advanced guard; but
the wagons, in which all their children and wives lived, they left
behind.</p>

<p>Advancing with his army as quick as possible, he fell in
with the Scythian divisions and pursued them, but they kept a
day's march before him. The Scythians, for Darius did not relax
his pursuit, fled, as had been determined, toward those nations
that had refused to assist them. When this had continued for a
considerable time, Darius sent a horseman to Indathyrsus, king of
the Scythians, with the following message: "Most miserable of
men, why dost thou continually fly, when it is in thy power to do
one of these two other things? For if thou thinkest thou art able
to resist my power, stand, and having ceased thy wanderings,
fight; but if thou art conscious of thy inferiority, in that case also
cease thy hurried march, and bringing earth and water as presents
to thy master, come to a conference." To this Indathyrsus, the
king of the Scythians, answered: "This is the case with me, O
Persian; I never yet fled from any man out of fear, nor do I now
so flee from thee; nor have I done any thing different now from
what I am wont to do, even in time of peace; but why I do not
forthwith fight thee, I will explain. We have no cities nor cultivated
lands, for which we are under any apprehension lest they
should be taken or ravaged. Yet, if it is by all means necessary
to come to battle at once, we have the sepulchres of our ancestors,
come, find these, and attempt to disturb them, then you will know
whether we will fight for our sepulchres or not; but before that,
unless we choose, we will not engage with thee. The only masters
I acknowledge are Jupiter my progenitor, and Vesta, queen of
the Scythians; but to thee, instead of presents of earth and water,
I will send such presents as are proper to come to thee. And in
answer to thy boast, that thou art my master, I bid thee weep."
(This is a Scythian saying.) The herald therefore departed carrying
this answer to Darius.</p>

<p>When the kings of the Scythians heard the name of servitude,
they were filled with indignation; whereupon they sent the division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
united with the Sauromatæ, which Scopasis commanded, with
orders to confer with the Ionians, who guarded the bridge over
the Ister. Those who were left resolved no longer to lead the Persians
about, but to attack them whenever they were taking their
meals; accordingly, observing the soldiers of Darius taking their
meals, they put their design in execution. The Scythian cavalry
always routed the Persian cavalry, but the Persian horsemen in
their flight fell back on the infantry, and the infantry supported
them. The Scythians, having beaten back the cavalry, wheeled
around through fear of the infantry. A very remarkable circumstance,
that was advantageous to the Persians and adverse to the
Scythians, when they attacked the camp of Darius, was the braying
of the asses and the appearance of the mules, for Scythia produces
neither ass nor mule; there is not in the whole Scythian
territory a single ass or mule, by reason of cold. The asses, then,
growing playful, put the Scythian horses into confusion; and frequently,
as they were advancing upon the Persians, when the
horses heard, midway, the braying of the asses, they wheeled
round in confusion, and were greatly amazed, pricking up their
ears, as having never before heard such a sound, nor seen such a
shape; and this circumstance in some slight degree affected the
fortune of the war.</p>

<p>When the Scythians saw the Persians in great commotion,
to detain them longer in Scythia they left some of their own cattle
in the care of the herdsmen and withdrew to another spot; and
the Persians coming up, took the cattle and exulted in what they
had done. When this had happened several times, Darius at last
was in a great strait, and the kings of the Scythians, having ascertained
this, sent a herald, bearing as gifts to Darius, a bird, a
mouse, a frog, and five arrows. The Persians asked the bearer
of the gifts the meaning of this present; but he answered that he
had no other orders than to deliver them and return immediately;
and he advised the Persians, if they were wise, to discover what
the gifts meant. Darius' opinion was that the Scythians meant
to give themselves up to him, as well as earth and water; forming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
his conjecture thus: since a mouse is bred in the earth, and subsists
on the same food as a man; a frog lives in the water; a bird
is very like a horse; and the arrows they deliver up as their whole
strength. But Gobryas, one of the seven who had deposed the
magus, did not coincide with this; he conjectured that the presents
intimated: "Unless, O Persians, ye become birds and fly into the
air, or become mice and hide yourselves beneath the earth, or
become frogs and leap into the lakes, ye shall never return home
again, but be stricken by these arrows." And thus the other
Persians interpreted the gifts.</p>

<p>The rest of the Scythians, after they had sent the presents to
Darius, drew themselves up opposite the Persians with their foot
and horse, as if they intended to come to an engagement; and as
the Scythians were standing in their ranks, a hare started in the
midst of them; and each went in pursuit of it. The Scythians being
in great confusion, and shouting loudly, Darius asked the meaning
of the uproar in the enemy's ranks; but when he heard that they
were pursuing a hare, he said to those he was accustomed to address
on such occasions: "These men treat us with great contempt;
and I am convinced that Gobryas spoke rightly concerning
the Scythian presents. I feel that we have need of the best advice,
how our return home may be effected in safety." To this
Gobryas answered: "O king, I was in some measure acquainted
by report with these men; but I have learned much more since I
came hither, and seen how they make sport of us. My opinion
is, that as soon as night draws on we should light fires, as we are
accustomed to do, and having deceived and left behind those
soldiers who are least able to bear hardships, and having tethered
all the asses, should depart before the Scythians direct their march
to the Ister, for the purpose of destroying the bridge, or the
Ionians take any resolution which may occasion our ruin."
Darius acted on this opinion: the infirm amongst the soldiers, and
those whose loss would be of the least consequence, he left on the
spot in the camp. And he left the asses, that they might make a
noise; and the men were left on this pretext, that he with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
strength of his army was about to attack the Scythians, and they,
during that time, would defend the camp. So Darius laid these
injunctions on those he was preparing to abandon, caused the fires
to be lighted, and marched away with all speed toward the Ister.
The asses, deserted by the multitude, began to bray much louder
than usual; so that the Scythians, hearing them, supposed of
course that the Persians were still at their station. When day
appeared, the men that were abandoned, discovering that they had
been betrayed by Darius, extended their hands to the Scythians,
and told them what had occurred; when they heard this the divisions
of the Scythians joined forces as quickly as possible and pursued
the Persians straight toward the Ister. But as a great part
of the Persian army consisted of infantry, and they did not know
the way, there being no roads cut, and as the Scythian army consisted
of cavalry, and knew the shortest route, they missed each
other, and the Scythians arrived at the bridge much before the
Persians. Finding that the Persians were not yet arrived, they
spoke to the Ionians who were on board the ships in these terms:
"Men of Ionia, the number of days appointed for your stay is
already passed, and you do not as you ought in continuing here;
but if you remained before through fear, now break up the passage
and depart as quickly as possible, rejoicing that you are free, and
give thanks to the gods and the Scythians. As for the man who
before was your master, we will so deal with him that he shall
never hereafter make war on any people."</p>

<p>Upon this the Ionians held a consultation. The opinion of
Miltiades the Athenian, who commanded and reigned over the
Chersonesites on the Hellespont, was, that they should comply with
the request of the Scythians, and restore liberty to Ionia. But
Histiæus the Milesian was of a contrary opinion, and said, "that
every one reigned over his own city through Darius; and if
Darius' power should be destroyed, neither would he himself continue
master of Miletus, nor any of the rest of other places; because
every one of the cities would choose to be governed rather by
a democracy than a tyranny." Histiæus had no sooner delivered this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
opinion, than all went over to his side, who had before assented to
that of Miltiades. Approving of the opinion of Histiæus, they determined
to add to it the following acts and words. To break up the
bridge on the Scythian side, as far as a bow-shot might reach, that
they might seem to do something, when in effect they did nothing;
and that the Scythians might not attempt to use violence and purpose
to cross the Ister by the bridge; and to say, while they were
breaking up the bridge on the Scythian side, they would do
every thing that might be agreeable to the Scythians. And,
Histiæus delivered the answer in the name of all, saying as follows:
"Men of Scythia, you have brought us good advice, and urge it
seasonably; you, on your part, have pointed out the right way to
us, and we on ours readily submit to you; for, as you see, we are
breaking up the passage, and will use all diligence, desiring to be
free. But while we are breaking it up, it is fitting you should seek
for them, and having found them, avenge us and yourselves on them,
as they deserve." The Scythians, believing a second time that the
Ionians were sincere, turned back to seek the Persians; but entirely
missed the way they had taken. The Scythians themselves
were the cause of this, as they had destroyed the pastures for the
horses in this direction, and filled in the wells; for if they had not
done this, they might easily have found the Persians; but now they
erred in the very thing which they thought they had contrived for
the best. For the Scythians sought the enemy by traversing those
parts of the country where there was forage and water for the
horses, thinking that they too would make their retreat by that
way. But the Persians carefully observing their former track, returned
by it, and thus with difficulty found the passage. As they
arrived in the night, and perceived the bridge broken off, they fell
into the utmost consternation, lest the Ionians had abandoned
them. There was with Darius an Egyptian, who had an exceedingly
loud voice. This man Darius commanded to stand on the bank
of the Ister, and called Histiæus the Milesian. He did so, and
Histiæus, having heard the first shout, brought up all the ships to
carry the army across, and joined the bridge. Thus the Persians
escaped.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>DESCRIPTION OF LIBYA.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Beginning</span> from Egypt the Adrymachidæ are the first of the
Libyans we meet with: they for the most part observe the usages
of Egypt, but they wear the same dress as the other Libyans.
The women wear a chain of bronze on each leg, and allow their
hair to grow long. Next to these are the Giligammæ, who occupy
the country westward, as far as the island Aphrodisias. Midway
on this coast the island of Platea is situated, which the Cyrenæans
colonized. The Asbystæ adjoin the Giligammæ westward; they
inhabit the country above Cyrene, but do not reach to the sea;
for the Cyrenæans occupy the sea-coast. They drive four-horsed
chariots, more than any of the Libyans, and endeavor to imitate
most of the customs of the Cyrenæans. The Nasamones, a very
numerous people, live to the westward. In summer they leave
their cattle on the coast, and go up to the region of Augila, in
order to gather the fruit of the palm-trees, which grow in great
numbers to a large size, and are all productive. They catch
locusts, dry them in the sun, reduce them to powder, and sprinkling
them in milk, drink them. In their oaths and divinations they
swear, laying their hands on the sepulchres of those who are
generally esteemed to have been the most just and excellent
persons among them; and they divine, going to the tombs of
their ancestors, and after having prayed, they lie down to sleep,
and whatever dream they have, they avail themselves of. In
pledging their faith, each party gives the other to drink out of his
hand, and drinks in turn from the other's hand; and if they have
no liquid, they take up some dust from the ground and lick it.</p>

<p>Above these to the north, in a country abounding with wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
beasts, live the Garamantes, who avoid all men and the society of
any others; they do not possess any warlike weapon, nor do they
know how to defend themselves. The Macæ adjoin them on the
sea-coast, westward; these shave their heads so as to leave a tuft,
and allowing the middle hair to grow, keep both sides shaved close
to the skin; in war they wear the skins of ostriches for defensive
armor. The river Cinyps, flowing through their country from a
hill called the Graces, discharges itself into the sea. This hill of
the Graces is thickly covered with trees, though all the rest of
Libya is bare. From the sea to this hill is a distance of two hundred
stades. The Lotophagi occupy the coast that projects to the
sea in front; they subsist only on the fruit of the lotus, which is
equal in size to the mastic berry, and in sweetness resembles the
fruit of the palm-tree. The Lotophagi make wine also from this
fruit.</p>

<p>The Machlyes, who also use the lotus, but in a less degree than
those before mentioned, adjoin the Lotophagi on the sea-coast.
They extend as far as a large river called Triton, which discharges
itself into the great lake Tritonis; and in it is an island named
Phla. They say that the Lacedæmonians were commanded by an
oracle to colonize this island. The following story is also told:
that Jason, when the building of the Argo was finished at the foot
of Mount Pelion, having put a hecatomb on board, and a bronze
tripod, sailed round the Peloponnesus, purposing to go to Delphi;
and as he was sailing off Malea, a north wind caught him and drove
him to Libya; and before he could descern the land, he found
himself in the shallows of the lake Tritonis; and as he was in
doubt how to extricate his ship, the story goes that a Triton appeared
to him, and bade Jason give him the tripod, promising that
he would show them the passage, and conduct them away in safety.
Jason consented, and the Triton showed them the passage out of
the shallows, and placed the tripod in his own temple; then pronouncing
an oracle from the tripod, he declared to Jason and his
companions all that should happen,&mdash;that "when one of the descendants
of those who sailed with him in the Argo should carry away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
the tripod, then it was fated that a hundred Grecian cities should
be built about the lake Tritonis." The neighboring nations of the
Libyans, when they heard this, concealed the tripods. The Auses
adjoin these Machlyes; they, as well as the Machlyes, dwell round
the lake Tritonis, and the Triton forms the boundary between
them. The Machlyes let the hair grow on the back of the head,
and the Auses on the front. At the annual festival of Minerva,
their virgins, dividing themselves into two companies, fight together
with stones and staves, affirming that they perform the
ancient rites to their native goddess, whom we call Minerva; and
those of the virgins who die from their wounds they call false
virgins. But before they leave off fighting, they, with one consent,
deck the maiden that excels in beauty, with a Corinthian helmet,
and a suit of Grecian armor, and placing her in a chariot conduct
her round the lake. In what way they formerly decorated the
maidens before the Greeks settled in their neighborhood, I am unable
to say; but I conjecture that they were decked in Egyptian
armor, for I am of opinion that the shield and helmet were
brought from Egypt into Greece.</p>

<p>Above these nomadic tribes, inland, Libya abounds in wild
beasts; beyond the wild-beast tract is a ridge of sand, stretching
from the Egyptian Thebes to the columns of Hercules. At intervals
of a ten days' journey in this ridge, there are pieces of salt in
large lumps on hills; and at the top of each hill, from the midst
of the salt, cool, sweet water gushes up. The first people you
come to after a ten days' journey from Thebes, are the Ammonians,
who have a temple resembling that of Theban Jupiter. For
the image of Jupiter at Thebes has the head of a ram. They have
also another kind of spring water which in the morning is tepid,
becomes colder about the time of full forum, and at midday is
very cold; at that time they water their gardens. As the day declines
it generally loses its coldness, till the sun sets, then the
water becomes tepid again, and continuing to increase in heat till
midnight, it then boils and bubbles up; when midnight is passed,
it gets cooler until morning. This fountain is called after the sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
Next to the Ammonians, along the ridge of sand, at the end of
another ten days' journey, there is a hill of salt, like that of the
Ammonians, and water, and men live round it; the name of this
region is Augila; and thither the Nasamonians go to gather dates.
From the Augilæ, at the end of another ten days' journey, is another
hill of salt and water, and many fruit-bearing palm-trees, as
also in other places; and men inhabit it who are called Garamantes,
a very powerful nation; they lay earth upon the salt, and then
sow their ground. From these to the Lotophagi the shortest
route is a journey of thirty days; amongst them cattle that feed
backwards are met with, having horns that are so bent forward,
that they are unable to feed forwards, because their horns would
stick in the ground. They differ from other kine in no other
respect, except that their hide is thicker and harder. These Garamantes
hunt the Ethiopian Troglodytes in four-horse chariots;
these Ethiopian Troglodytes are the swiftest of foot of all men of
whom we have heard any account given. The Troglodytes feed
upon serpents and lizards, and such kinds of reptiles; they speak a
language like no other, but screech like bats.</p>

<p>At the distance of another ten days' journey from the Garamantes
is another hill of salt and water, around which a people live
who are called Atarantes; they are the only race we know of who
have not personal names. For the name Atarantes belongs
to them collectively, and to each one of them no name is
given. They curse the sun as he passes over their heads, and
moreover utter against him the foulest invectives, because he consumes
by his scorching heat, the men themselves and their country.
Afterward, at the end of still another ten days' journey, there is
one more hill of salt and water, and men live round it, near a
mountain called Atlas; it is narrow and circular on all sides, and
is said to be so lofty that its top can never be seen; it is never
free from clouds, either in summer or winter. The inhabitants say
that it is the Pillar of Heaven. From this mountain the men derive
their appellation, for they are called Atlantes. They are said
neither to eat the flesh of any animal, nor to see visions. As far,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
then, as these Atlantes, I am able to mention the names of the
nations that inhabit this ridge, but not beyond them. This ridge,
however, extends as far as the pillars of Hercules, and even beyond;
and there is a mine of salt in it at intervals of ten days'
journey, and men dwelling there. The houses of them all are built
of blocks of salt, for in these parts of Libya no rain falls; walls
being of salt could not of course stand long if rain did fall. The
salt dug out there is white and purple in appearance. Above this
ridge, to the south and interior of Libya, the country is a desert,
without water, without animals, without rain, and without wood;
and there is no kind of moisture in it.</p>

<p>Westward of lake Tritonis, the Libyans are no longer nomads,
nor do they follow the same customs, with respect to their children,
as the nomads are accustomed to do; for the nomadic Libyans,
whether all I am unable to say with certainty, but many of them,
when their children are four years old, burn the veins on the
crown of their heads, with uncleaned sheep's wool; and some of
them do so on the veins in the temples; to the end that humors
flowing down from the head may not injure them as long as they
live: and, for this reason, they say they are so very healthy, for
the Libyans are in truth the most healthy of all men with whom
we are acquainted. But I simply repeat what the Libyans themselves
say. From the Libyan women the Greeks derived the attire
and ægis of Minerva's statues; for, except that the dress of
the Libyan women is leather, and the fringes that hang from the
ægis are not serpents, but made of thongs, they are otherwise
equipped in the same way; and, moreover, the very name proves
that the garb of the Palladia comes from Libya; for the Libyan
women throw over their dress, goats' skins without the hair,
fringed and dyed with red. From these goats' skins the Greeks
have borrowed the name of Ægis. And the howlings in the
temples were, I think, first derived from there; for the Libyan
women practise the same custom, and do it well. The Greeks
also learnt from the Libyans to yoke four horses abreast. All the
nomads, except the Nasamonians, inter their dead in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
manner as the Greeks; these bury them in a sitting posture,
watching when one is about to expire, that they may set him up,
and he may not die supine. Their dwellings are compacted of the
asphodel shrub, interwoven with rushes, and are portable.</p>

<p>To the west of the river Triton, Libyans who are husbandmen
next adjoin the Auses; they are accustomed to live in houses, and
are called Maxyes. They let the hair grow on the right side of
the head, and shave the left; and bedaub the body with vermilion:
they say that they are descended from men who came
from Troy. This region, and all the rest of Libya westward, is
much more infested by wild beasts and more thickly wooded than
the country of the nomads; for the eastern country of Libya,
which the nomads inhabit, is low and sandy, as far as the river
Triton; but the country westward of this, which is occupied by
agriculturists, is very mountainous, woody, and abounds with wild
beasts. For amongst them there are enormous serpents, and lions,
elephants, bears, asps, asses with horns, and monsters with dogs'
heads and without heads, who have eyes in their breasts, at least
as the Libyans say, together with wild men and wild women.
None of these things are found among the nomads, but others of
the following kind: pygargi, antelopes, buffaloes, and asses, not
such as have horns, but others that never drink; and oryes, from
the horns of which are made the elbows of the Phœnician citherns;
in size this beast is equal to an ox; and foxes, hyænas, porcupines,
wild rams, dictyes, thoes, panthers, boryes, and land crocodiles
about three cubits long, very much like lizards; ostriches, and
small serpents, each with one horn. These, then, are the wild
animals in that country, besides such as are met with elsewhere,
except the stag and the wild boar; but the stag and the wild boar
are never seen in Libya. They have three sorts of mice there;
some called dipodes, or two-footed; others, zegeries, this name is
Libyan, and means the same as the word signifying hillocks in
Greek; and hedgehogs. There are also weasels produced in the
silphium, like those at Tartessus.</p>

<p>The Zaveces adjoin the Maxyan Libyans; their women drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
their chariots in war. The Gyzantes adjoin them; amongst them
bees make a great quantity of honey, and it is said that confectioners
make much more. All these paint themselves with vermilion,
and eat monkeys, which abound in their mountains. Near them,
the Carthaginians say, lies an island called Cyraunis, two hundred
stades in length, inconsiderable in breadth, easy of access from the
continent, and abounding in olive trees and vines. In it is a lake,
from the mud of which the girls of the country draw up gold dust
by means of feathers daubed with pitch. Whether this is true I
know not, but I write what is related; it may be so, however, for
I have myself seen pitch drawn up out of a lake and from water in
Zacynthus; and there are several lakes there, the largest of them
is seventy feet every way, and two orgyæ in depth; into this they
let down a pole with a myrtle branch fastened to the end, and then
draw up pitch adhering to the myrtle; it has the smell of asphalt,
but is in other respects better than the pitch of Pieria. They pour
it into a cistern dug near the lake, and when they have collected a
sufficient quantity, draw it off from the cistern into jars. All that
falls into the lake passes under ground, and appears again upon the
surface of the sea, which is about four stades distant from the lake.
This account given of the island may probably be true. The
Carthaginians further say, that beyond the pillars of Hercules
there is an inhabited region of Libya; when they arrive among
these people and have unloaded their merchandise, they set it in
order on the shore, go on board their ships, and make a great
smoke; the inhabitants, seeing the smoke, come down to the sea,
deposit gold in exchange for the merchandise, and withdraw to
some distance from the merchandise; the Carthaginians then,
going ashore, examine the gold, and if the quantity seems sufficient
for the merchandise they take it up and sail away; but if it
is not sufficient, they go on board their ships again and wait; the
natives then approach and deposit more gold, until they have satisfied
them; neither party ever wrongs the other; for they do not
touch the gold before it is made adequate to the value of the merchandise,
nor do the natives touch the merchandise before the
other party has taken the gold.</p>

No part of Libya appears to me so good in fertility as to be
compared with Asia or Europe, except only the district of Cinyps;
for the land bears the same name as the river, and is equal to the
best land for the production of corn; nor is it at all like the rest
of Libya; for the soil is black, and well watered with springs, and
it is neither affected at all by drought, nor is it injured by imbibing
too much rain, which falls in this part of
Libya. The proportion of the produce
of this land equals that of Babylon. The
land also which the Euesperides occupy
is good; for when it yields its best, it
produces a hundred-fold; but that in
Cinyps three hundred-fold. The district
of Cyrene, which is the highest of that
part of Libya which the nomads occupy,
has three seasons, a circumstance worthy
of admiration; for the first fruits near
the sea swell so as to be ready for the
harvest and vintage; when these are
gathered in, the fruits of the middle region,
away from the sea, swell so as to
be gathered in, these they call uplands;
and just as this middle harvest has been
gathered in, that in the highest part
becomes ripe and swells. So that when
the first crop has been drunk and eaten,
the last comes in. Thus harvest occupies
the Cyrenæans during eight months.
This maybe sufficient to say concerning
these things.</p>

<p>The Persians once upon a time, sent against the city of Barce,
laid siege to it for nine months, digging passages under ground
that reached to the walls, and making vigorous assaults. Now
these excavations were discovered by a worker of bronze, carrying
a bronze shield round within the wall, and applying it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
ground within the city: in other places to which he applied it, it
made no noise, but at the parts that were excavated, the metal of
the shield sounded. The Barcæans, therefore, countermining them
in that part, slew the Persians who were employed in the excavation.
When much time had been spent, and many had fallen on
both sides, and not the fewest on the side of the Persians, Amasis,
general of the land forces, had recourse to the following stratagem:
Finding that the Barcæans could not be taken by force, but might
be by artifice, he dug a wide pit by night, laid weak planks of
wood over it, and on the surface over the planks he spread a heap
of earth, making it level with the rest of the ground. At daybreak
he invited the Barcæans to a conference; they gladly assented,
thinking that at last they were pleased to come to terms: and they
made an agreement of the following nature, concluding the treaty
over the concealed pit: "That as long as this earth shall remain
as it is, the treaty should continue in force; and that the Barcæans
should pay a reasonable tribute to the king, and that the Persians
should form no new designs against the Barcæans." After the
treaty the Barcæans, confiding in the Persians, went freely out of
the city, and allowed any one of the Persians who chose to pass
within the wall, throwing open all the gates. But the Persians,
having broken down the concealed bridge, rushed within the wall:
having not fully kept their oath. The Persians reduced the Barcæans
to slavery and took their departure. But king Darius gave
them a village in the district of Bactria, to dwell in, and the name
of Barce was given to this village, which was still inhabited in my
time, in the Bactrian territory.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>CONQUESTS OF THE GENERALS OF DARIUS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Persians, left in Europe by Darius under the command of
Megabazus, subdued the Perinthians first of the Hellespontines,
who were unwilling to submit to Darius, and had been before
roughly handled by the Pæonians. For an oracle had admonished
the Pæonians to invade the Perinthians, and if the Perinthians,
when encamped against them, should challenge them, shouting
to them by name, then to attack, but if they should not shout out
to them, not to attack. A threefold single combat took place between
them according to a challenge; for they matched a man with
a man, a horse with a horse, and a dog with a dog. The Perinthians,
victorious in two of these combats, through excess of joy sang
the Pæon, whereupon the Pæonians conjectured that this was the
meaning of the oracle, and said among themselves: "Now surely
the oracle must be accomplished; now it is our part to act."
The Pæonians attacked the Perinthians as they were singing the
Pæon, gained a complete victory, and left but few of them alive.</p>

<p>The nation of the Thracians is the greatest of all among men,
except the Indians; and if they were governed by one man, or
acted in concert, they would, in my opinion, be invincible, and by
far the most powerful of all nations. But as this is impracticable,
and it is impossible that they should ever be united, they are
weak.</p>

<p>Beyond the Ister appears to be an interminable desert, and the
only men that I am able to hear of as dwelling there are those called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
Sigynnæ, who wear the Medic dress; their horses are shaggy all
over the body, to five fingers in depth of hair; they are small,
flat-nosed, and unable to carry men; but when yoked to chariots
are very fleet. They say that these people are a colony of Medes.
How they can have been a colony of Medes I cannot comprehend;
but any thing may happen in the course of time.</p>

<p>There is a curious people who inhabit Lake Prasias itself, who
were not at all subdued by Megabazus;&mdash;they live upon the lake
in dwellings erected upon planks fitted on lofty piles, which are
driven in the middle of the lake, with a narrow entrance from the
main land by a single bridge. These piles that support the planks
all the citizens anciently placed there at the common charge; but
afterward they established a law to the following effect: Whenever
a man marries, for each wife he sinks three piles, bringing wood
from a mountain called Orbelus: but every man has several wives.
Each one has a hut on the planks, in which he dwells, with a trap-door
closely fitted in the planks, and leading down to the lake.
They tie the young children with a cord around the foot, for fear
they should fall into the lake beneath. To their horses and beasts
of burden they give fish for fodder; of which there is such an
abundance, that you have simply to open your trap-door, let down
an empty basket by a cord into the lake, when, after waiting a
short time, you draw it up full of fish.</p>

<p>Megabazus, after conquering the Pæonians, arrived at the
Hellespont, crossed over, and came to Sardis. In the meantime,
Histiæus the Milesian was building a wall around the place, which,
at his own request, he had received from Darius as a reward for
his services in preserving the bridge: this place was near the river
Strymon, and its name Myrcinus. Megabazus, upon learning
what was being done by Histiæus, as soon as he reached Sardis
said to Darius: "O king, what have you done, in allowing a
crafty and subtle Greek to possess a city in Thrace, where there is
an abundance of timber fit for building ships and plenty of wood
for oars, and silver mines? A great multitude of Greeks and barbarians
dwell around, who, when they have obtained him as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
leader, will do whatever he may command, both by day and by
night. Put a stop therefore to the proceedings of this man, that
you may not be harassed by a domestic war; send for him in a
gentle manner, and stop him: and when you have him in your
power, take care that he never returns to the Greeks." Megabazus
easily persuaded Darius, since he wisely foresaw what was to happen.
So Darius sent a messenger to Myrcinus, who spoke as
follows: "Histiæus, King Darius says thus: I find on consideration
that there is no man better affected to me and my affairs than
thyself; and this I have learnt, not by words, but actions; now,
since I have great designs to put in execution, come to me by all
means, that I may communicate them to thee." Histiæus, giving
credit to these words, and at the time considering
it a great honor to become a
counsellor of the king, went to Sardis:
when he arrived, Darius said, "Histiæus,
I have sent for you on this occasion. As
soon as I returned from Scythia, and you
were out of my sight, I have wished for
nothing so much as to see you and converse
with you again; being persuaded
that a friend who is both intelligent and well
affected, is the most valuable of all possessions;
both of which I am able to testify from my own knowledge
concur in you, as regards my affairs. You have done well in
coming, and I make you this offer: Think no more of Miletus,
nor of the new-founded city in Thrace; but follow me to Susa,
have the same that I have, and be the partner of my table and
counsels." And Darius appointed Artaphernes, his brother by the
same father, to be governor of Sardis, and departed for Susa,
taking Histiæus with him. He first nominated Otanes to be general
of the forces on the coast, whose father, Sisamnes, one of the
royal judges, King Cambyses had put to death and flayed, because
he had given an unjust judgment for a sum of money. He had
his skin torn off, and cut into thongs, and extended it on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
bench on which he used to sit, when he pronounced judgment;
then Cambyses appointed as judge in the room of Sisamnes, whom
he had slain and flayed, the son of Sisamnes, admonishing him to
remember on what seat he sat to administer justice. This very
Otanes, then, being now appointed successor to Megabazus in the
command of the army, subdued the Byzantians and Chalcedonians,
and took Antandros, which belongs to the territory of Troas, and
Lamponium; and obtaining ships from the Lesbians, he took
Lemnos and Imbrus, both of which were then inhabited by Pelasgians.
The Lemnians fought valiantly, and defended themselves
for some time, but were at length overcome; and over those who
survived, the Persians set up Lycaretus as governor, the brother
of Mæandrius, who had reigned in Samos. Otanes enslaved and
subdued them all for various alleged reasons: some he charged
with desertion to the Scythians; others he accused of having
harassed Darius' army in their return home from the Scythians.</p>

<p>Afterward, for the intermission from misfortune was not of
long duration, evils arose a second time to the Ionians from Naxos
and Miletus. For, on the one hand, Naxos surpassed all the
islands in opulence; and on the other, Miletus, at the same time,
had attained the summit of its prosperity, and was accounted the
ornament of Ionia. Some of the opulent men, exiled from Naxos
by the people, went to Miletus: the governor of Miletus happened
to be Aristagoras, son of Molpagoras, son-in-law and cousin of
Histiæus, whom Darius detained at Susa. These Naxians arrived
at Miletus, entreated Aristagoras, if he could, by any means, to
give them some assistance so that they might return to their
own country. He, perceiving that if by his means they should
return to their city, he might get the dominion of Naxos, used the
friendship of Histiæus as a pretence, and addressed the following
discourse to them: "I am not able of myself to furnish you with
a force sufficient to reinstate you against the wishes of the Naxians,
who are in possession of the city, for I hear that the Naxians have
eight thousand heavy-armed men, and a considerable number of
ships of war. Yet I will contrive some way, and use my best endeavors;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
my scheme is this: Artaphernes happens to be my
friend; he is son of Hystaspes and brother of king Darius, and
commands all the maritime parts of Asia, and has a large army
and navy. This man, I am persuaded, will do whatever we desire."
The Naxians urged Aristagoras to go about it in the best way he
could, and bade him promise presents, and their expenses to the
army, for they would repay it; having great expectation that
when they should appear at Naxos the Naxians would do whatever
they should order, as also would the other islanders; for of
these Cyclades islands not one was as yet subject to Darius.</p>

<p>Accordingly Aristagoras journeyed to Sardis, and told Artaphernes,
that Naxos was an island of no great extent, to be sure,
but beautiful and fertile, and near Ionia, and in it was much wealth
and many slaves. "Do send an army against this country, to reinstate
those who have been banished; and if you do this, I have,
in the first place, a large sum of money ready, in addition to the
expenses of the expedition, for it is just that we who lead you on
should supply that; and in the next, you will acquire for the king
Naxos itself, and the islands dependent upon it, Paros, Andros,
and the rest that are called Cyclades. Setting out from there you
will easily attack Eubœa, a large and wealthy island, not less than
Cyprus, and very easy to be taken. A hundred ships are sufficient
to subdue them all." The reply was quickly given: "You
propose things advantageous to the king's house, and advise every
thing well, except the number of ships; instead of one hundred,
two hundred shall be ready at the commencement of the spring.
But it is necessary that the king himself should approve of the
design." Aristagoras, wild with delight, went back to Miletus.
And Artaphernes, finding that Darius himself approved of the plan,
made ready two hundred triremes, and a very numerous body of
Persians and other allies: and he appointed Megabates general,
a Persian of the family of the Archimenidæ, his own and Darius'
nephew, whose daughter, if the report be true, was afterward betrothed
to Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus the Lacedæmonian, who
aspired to become tyrant of Greece. Artaphernes, having appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
Megabates general, sent forward the army to Aristagoras.</p>

<p>Megabates, with Aristagoras, the Ionian forces, and the Naxians,
sailed professedly for the Hellespont; but when he arrived
at Chios, anchored at Caucasa, that he might cross over from there
to Naxos by a north wind. However, it was fated that the Naxians
were not to perish by this armament, as the following event
occurred: As Megabates was going round the watches on board
the ships, he found no one on guard on board a Myndian ship;
indignant at this, he ordered his body-guards to find the captain of
this ship, whose name was Scylax, and to bind him with his body
half-way through the lower row-lock of the vessel, so that his head
should be on the outside of the vessel, and his legs within. Some
one told Aristagoras that Megabates had bound and disgraced his
Myndian friend. He went therefore and interceded for him with
the Persian, but, when he found he could obtain nothing, went
himself and released him. Megabates, hearing of this, was very
indignant, and enraged at Aristagoras, and told him so; "but,"
said Aristagoras, "what have you to do with these matters? Did
not Artaphernes send you to obey me, and to sail wheresoever I
should command?" Megabates, still more exasperated at this, as
soon as night arrived, dispatched men in a ship to Naxos, to inform
the Naxians of the impending danger. The Naxians, who
had not a suspicion that this armament was coming against them,
immediately carried every thing from the fields into the town, and,
with plenty of food and drink, prepared to undergo a siege, so the
Persians had to attack men well fortified, and after besieging them
four months, consumed all the supplies they had brought with
them, together with large sums furnished by Aristagoras, and
wanting still more to carry on the siege, they were forced to build
a fortress for the Naxian exiles, and retire to the continent unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Aristagoras was thus unable to fulfil his promise to Artaphernes;
while at the same time the expenses of the expedition pressed
heavily on him on account of the ill success of the army; and having
incurred the ill will of Megabates to such an extent that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
he feared that he should be deprived of the government of Miletus,
he meditated a revolt. It happened at the same time that a
messenger with his head tattooed came from Susa from Histiæus,
urging Aristagoras to revolt from the king. For Histiæus, being
desirous to communicate to Aristagoras his wish for him to revolt,
had no other means of signifying it with safety, because the roads
were guarded; therefore, having shaved the head of the most
trustworthy of his slaves, he marked it with a sharp iron, and
waited till the hair had grown again, then sent him to Miletus
without other instructions except that when he arrived at Miletus
he should desire Aristagoras to shave off his hair and look upon
his head: the punctures, as I have said before, signified a wish for
him to revolt. Histiæus did this because he looked upon his
detention at Susa as a great misfortune; while if a revolt should
take place he had great hopes that he should be sent down to the
coast; but if Miletus made no new attempt, he thought that
he should never go there again. It was resolved to revolt,
and messengers were sent to the force that had returned from
Naxos, and which was at Myus, to seize the captains on board the
ships. Aristagoras thus openly revolted, devising every thing he
could against Darius. And first, in pretence, having laid aside
the sovereignty, he established an equality in Miletus, in order
that the Milesians might more readily join with him in the revolt.
Afterward he effected the same throughout the rest of Ionia,
expelling some of the tyrants; and he delivered up those whom
he had taken from on board the ships that had sailed with him
against Naxos, to the cities, in order to gratify the people, giving
them up to the respective cities, from whence each came. The
Mityleneans, as soon as they received Coes, led him out, and
stoned him to death; but the Cymeans let their tyrant go;
and in like manner most of the others let theirs go. Accordingly
there was a suppression of tyrants throughout the cities. But
Aristagoras enjoined them all to appoint magistrates in each
of the cities, and went himself in a trireme as ambassador to
Sparta, for it was necessary for him to procure some powerful
alliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
Aristagoras arrived at Sparta, when Cleomenes held the
government; and he went to confer with him, as the Lacedæmonians
say, carrying a bronze tablet, on which was engraved the
circumference of the whole earth, the whole sea, and all rivers.
"Wonder not, Cleomenes," said Aristagoras, "at my eagerness in
coming here, for it is a great sorrow to us that the children of
Ionians should be slaves instead of free, and above all others it is
a disgrace to you, inasmuch as you are at the head of Greece. I
adjure you by the Grecian gods, rescue the Ionians, who are of
your own blood, from servitude. It is easy for you to effect this,
for the barbarians are not valiant; whereas you, in matters relating
to war, have attained to the utmost height of glory; their mode
of fighting is, with bows and short spears, and they engage in
battle wearing loose trousers, and turbans on their heads, so that
they are easy to be overcome. Besides, there are treasures belonging
to those who inhabit that continent, such as are not possessed
by all other nations together; gold, silver, bronze, variegated
garments, beasts of burden, and slaves; all these you may
have if you will. They live adjoining one another as I will show
you. Next to these Ionians are the Lydians, who inhabit a fertile
country, and abound in silver." As he said this he showed the map
of the earth, which he had brought with him, engraved on a tablet.
"Next to the Lydians," proceeded Aristagoras, "are these Phrygians
to the eastward, who are the richest in cattle and in corn of
all with whom I am acquainted. Next to the Phrygians are the
Cappadocians, whom we call Syrians; and bordering on them,
the Cilicians, extending to this sea in which the island of Cyprus
is situated; they pay an annual tribute of five hundred talents to
the king. Next to the Cilicians are these Armenians, who also
abound in cattle; and next to the Armenians are the Metienians,
who occupy this country; and next them this territory of Cissia, in
which Susa is situated, on this river Choaspes, and here the great
king resides, and here are his treasures of wealth. If you take
this city, you may boldly contend with Jupiter in wealth. As it is,
you carry on war for a country of small extent, and not very fertile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
and of narrow limits, with the Messenians, who are your
equals in valor, and with the Arcadians and Argives, who have
nothing akin to gold or silver, the desire of which induces men to
hazard their lives in battle. But when an opportunity is offered to
conquer all Asia with ease, will you prefer any thing else?"
"Milesian friend," said Cleomenes, "I defer to give you an answer
until the third day." They met at the appointed time and place, and
Cleomenes asked Aristagoras, how many days' journey it was from
the sea of the Ionians to the king. Aristagoras, though he was
cunning in other things, and had deceived him with much address,
made a slip in this; for he should not have told the real fact, if he
wished to draw the Spartans into Asia; whereas he told him
frankly that it was a three months' journey up there. Cutting
short the rest of the description which Aristagoras was proceeding
to give of the journey, Cleomenes said: "My friend, from Miletus,
depart from Sparta before sunset; for you speak no agreeable
language to the Lacedæmonians, in wishing to lead them a three
months' journey from the sea;" and Cleomenes went home.
Aristagoras, nothing daunted, taking an olive-branch in his hand,
went to the house of Cleomenes, entered in, as a suppliant, and
besought Cleomenes to listen to him. The latter's little child, a
daughter, whose name was Gorgo, stood by him; she happened
to be his only child, and was about eight or nine years of age.
Cleomenes bade him say what he wished, and not mind the presence
of the little girl. Thereupon Aristagoras promised him ten
talents, if he would do as he desired; and as Cleomenes refused,
Aristagoras went on increasing his offers, until he promised fifty
talents, when little Gorgo cried out, "Papa, this stranger will corrupt
you, if you don't quickly depart." Cleomenes, pleased with
the advice of the child, retired to another apartment; and Aristagoras
was forced to leave Sparta altogether, without ever getting
another opportunity to give further particulars of the route to the
city of the great king.</p>

<p>With respect to this road, the case is as follows: There are
royal stations all along, and excellent inns, and the whole road is
through an inhabited and safe country. There are twenty stations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
extending through Lydia and Phrygia, and the distance is ninety-four
parasangs and a half. After Phrygia, the river Halys is met
with, at which there are gates, which it is absolutely necessary to
pass through, and thus to cross the river; there is also a considerable
fort on it. When you cross over into Cappadocia, and traverse
that country to the borders of Cilicia, there are eight and
twenty stations, and one hundred and four parasangs; and on the
borders of these people, you go through two gates, and pass by
two forts. When you have gone through these and made the
journey through Cilicia, there are three stations, and fifteen parasangs
and a half. The boundary of Cilicia and Armenia is a river
that is crossed in boats, called the Euphrates. In Armenia there
are fifteen stations for resting-places, and fifty-six parasangs and a
half; there is also a fort at the stations. Four rivers that are
crossed in boats flow through this country, which it is absolutely
necessary to ferry over. First, the Tigris; then the second and
third have the same name, though they are not the same river,
nor flow from the same source. For the first mentioned of these
flows from the Armenians, and the latter from the Matienians.
The fourth river is called the Gyndes, which Cyrus once distributed
into three hundred and sixty channels. As you enter from Armenia
into the country of Matiene, there are four stations; and
from thence as you proceed to the Cissian territory there are
eleven stations, and forty-two parasangs and a half, to the river
Choaspes, which also must be crossed in boats; on this Susa is
built. All these stations amount to one hundred and eleven,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
as you go up from Sardis to Susa. Now if the royal road has been
correctly measured in parasangs, and if the parasang is equal to
thirty stades, as indeed it is, from Sardis to the royal palace, called
Memnonia, is a distance of thirteen thousand five hundred stades,
the parasangs being four hundred and fifty; and by those who
travel one hundred and fifty stades every day, just ninety days are
spent on the journey. So Aristagoras spoke correctly when he
stated the distance to Susa.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>THE IONIAN REVOLT.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristagoras</span> the Milesian, having been expelled from Sparta
by Cleomenes the Lacedæmonian, repaired to Athens; for this
city was much more powerful than the rest. Presenting himself
before the people, he said the same that he had done at Sparta,
respecting the wealth of Asia and the Persian mode of warfare,
how they used neither shield nor spear, and could be easily conquered.
He said also that the Milesians were a colony of the
Athenians, and it was but reasonable that they, having such great
power, should rescue them. And as there was nothing he did not
promise, being very much in earnest, at length he persuaded them.
It appears to be more easy to impose upon a multitude than one
man; this schemer, you see, was not able to impose upon Cleomenes
the Lacedæmonian singly, but did upon thirty thousand
Athenians. Twenty ships were sent to succor the Ionians, and
Melanthius commander over them, a citizen who was universally
esteemed. These ships proved the source of calamities both to
Greeks and barbarians. Aristagoras sailed first, arrived at Miletus,
and had recourse to a project from which no advantage could result
to the Ionians; nor did he employ it for that purpose, but
that he might vex king Darius. He sent a man into Phrygia, to
the Pæonians, who had been carried away captive by Megabazus,
from the river Strymon, and occupied a tract in Phrygia, and a
village by themselves. Arrived among the Pæonians, the messenger
spoke as follows: "Men of Pæonia, Aristagoras, tyrant of
Miletus, has sent me to suggest to you a mode of deliverance, if
you will take his advice. For all Ionia has revolted from the king,
and offers you an opportunity of returning safe to your own country;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
as far as to the coast take care of yourselves, and we will provide
for the rest." When the Pæonians heard these words, they
considered it a very joyful event, and taking with them their children
and wives, fled to the coast; though some of them, through
fear, remained where they were. When the Pæonians reached
the coast, they crossed over to Chios, when a large body of Persian
cavalry came on their heels, and sent orders to Chios to the Pæonians,
commanding them to return. The Pæonians did not listen
to the proposal; but the Chians conveyed them to Lesbos, and
the Lesbians forwarded them to Doriscus; thence proceeding on
foot they reached Pæonia.</p>

<p>The Athenians arrived with twenty ships, bringing with them
five triremes of the Eretrians, who engaged in this expedition out
of good-will to the Milesians, in order to repay a former obligation;
for the Milesians had formerly joined the Eretrians in the
war against the Chalcidians. When these had arrived, and the
rest of the allies had come up, Aristagoras resolved to make an
expedition to Sardis. He himself did not march with the army,
but remained at Miletus, and appointed as generals of the Milesians,
his own brother Charopinus, and of the other citizens Hermophantus.
The Ionians arrived at Ephesus with this force, left
their ships at Coressus, in the Ephesian territory, and advanced
with a numerous army, taking Ephesians for their guides; and
marching by the side of the river Cayster, they crossed Mount
Tmolus, and reached and took Sardis without opposition; all except
the citadel, for Artaphernes with a strong garrison defended
the citadel. The following accident prevented them, after they
had taken the city, from plundering it. Most of the houses in
Sardis were built with reeds; and such of them as were built with
brick, had roof of reeds. A soldier happened to set fire to one of
these, and immediately the flame spread from house to house, and
consumed the whole city. While the city was burning, the
Lydians, and as many of the Persians as were in the city, being
enclosed on every side, and having no means of escaping from the
city, rushed together to the market-place, and to the river Pactolus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
which, bringing down grains of gold from Mount Tmolus, flows
through the middle of the market-place, and then discharges itself
into the river Hermus, and that into the sea. The Lydians and
Persians, being assembled on this Pactolus and at the market-place,
were constrained to defend themselves: and the Ionians,
seeing some of the enemy standing on their defence, and others coming
up in great numbers, retired through fear to the mountain called
Tmolus, and thence under favor of the night retreated to their
ships. Thus Sardis was burnt, and in it the temple of the native
goddess Cybebe; the Persians, making a pretext of this, afterwards
burnt in retaliation the temples of Greece. As soon as the
Persians who had settlements on this side the river Halys were informed
of these things, they drew together and marched to assist
the Lydians; the Ionians were no longer at Sardis; but following
on their track they overtook them at Ephesus, where the Ionians
drew out in battle-array against them, and coming to an engagement,
were sorely beaten; and the Persians slew many of them,
among other persons of distinction, Eualcis, general of the Eretrians,
who had gained the prize in the contests for the crown, and
had been much celebrated by Simonides the Cean. Those who
escaped from the battle were dispersed throughout the cities.</p>

<p>Such was the result of the encounter. Afterward, the Athenians,
totally abandoning the Ionians, though Aristagoras urgently
solicited them by ambassadors, refused to send them any assistance.
The Ionians, deprived of the alliance of the Athenians, (for
they had conducted themselves in such a manner toward Darius
from the first,) nevertheless prepared for war with the king. And
sailing to the Hellespont, they reduced Byzantium and all the
other cities in that quarter to their obedience. They then sailed out
of the Hellespont, and gained over to their alliance the greater part
of Caria; for the city of Caunus, which before would not join their
alliance, when they had burnt Sardis, came over to their side.</p>

<p>When it was told king Darius, that Sardis had been taken and
burnt by the Athenians and Ionians, and that Aristagoras the
Milesian was the chief of the confederacy and the contriver of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
that enterprise, it is related that he took no account of the Ionians,
well knowing that they would not escape unpunished for their rebellion,
but inquired where the Athenians were; then having been
informed, he called for a bow, put an arrow into it, let it fly toward
heaven, and as he shot it into the air, exclaimed: "O Jupiter, grant
that I may revenge myself on the Athenians!" Then he commanded
one of his attendants, every time dinner was set before
him, to say thrice: "Sire, remember the Athenians." Summoning
to his presence Histiæus the Milesian, whom he had already detained
a long time, Darius said: "I am informed, Histiæus, that
your lieutenant, to whom you intrusted Miletus, has attempted innovations
against me; for he has brought men from the other continent,
and with them Ionians, who shall give me satisfaction for
what they have done; and has deprived me of Sardis. Now, can it
appear to you that this is right? Could such a thing have been done
without your advice? Beware lest hereafter you expose yourself
to blame." To this Histiæus answered: "O king, what have you
said? That I should advise a thing from which any grief, great
or little, should ensue to you! With what object should I do so?
What am I in want of? I, who have all things the same as you,
and am deemed worthy to share all your counsels? But if my
lieutenant has done any such thing as you mention, be assured he
has done it of his own contrivance. But I do not believe the account,
that the Milesians and my lieutenant have attempted any
innovations against your authority. Yet if you have heard the
truth, consider, O king, what mischief you have done in withdrawing
me from the coast. For the Ionians seem, when I was out of
their sight, to have done what they long ago desired to do; and
had I been in Ionia not one city would have stirred. Suffer me
therefore to go with all speed to Ionia, that I may restore all things
there to their former condition, and deliver into your hands this
lieutenant of Miletus, who has plotted the whole. When I have
done this according to your mind, I swear by the royal gods, not
to put off the garments which I shall wear when I go down to
Ionia, before I have made the great island Sardinia tributary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
you." His speaking thus deceived the king; Darius was persuaded,
and let him go, charging him to return to Susa, as soon as he
should have accomplished what he had promised.</p>

<p>While the news concerning Sardis was going up to the king,
tidings were brought to Onesilus the Salaminian, as he was besieging
the Amathusians, that Artybius, a Persian, leading a large
Persian force on shipboard, was to be expected in Cyprus. Onesilus
accordingly sent heralds to the different parts of Ionia, inviting
them to assist him; and the Ionians, without any protracted
deliberation, arrived at Cyprus with a large armament. The Persians
crossed over in ships from Cilicia, and marched by land
against Salamis.</p>

<p>Then the kings of the Cyprians drew up their forces in line,
and stationed the best of the Salaminians and Solians against the
Persians. Onesilus voluntarily took up his position directly
against Artybius, the general of the Persians. Artybius used to
ride on a horse, that had been taught to rear up against an armed
enemy. Onesilus had a shield-bearer, a Carian, well skilled in
matters of war, and otherwise full of courage, to whom he said:
"I am informed that the horse of Artybius rears up, and with his
feet and mouth attacks whomsoever he is made to engage with;
tell me which you will watch and strike, whether the horse or Artybius
himself." His attendant answered: "I am ready to do both,
or either of them, but a king and a general ought, I think, to engage
with a king and a general. If you vanquish one who is a general,
your glory is great; while if he should vanquish you, which may
the gods avert, to fall by a noble hand is but half the calamity. We
servants should engage with other servants, and also against a
horse, whose tricks you need not fear at all; for I promise you he
shall never again rear up against any man." Forthwith the forces
joined battle by land and sea. Now, the Ionians fought valiantly
on that day, when the armies met in close combat; and when
Artybius, seated on his horse, bore down upon Onesilus. Onesilus,
as he had concerted with his shield-bearer, struck Artybius himself;
and as the horse was throwing his feet against the shield of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
Onesilus, the Carian with a scythe cut off the horse's feet. So
that Artybius, the general of the Persians, fell together with his
horse on the spot. While the rest were fighting, Stesenor, of
Curium, deserted with no inconsiderable body of men, and the
chariots of war belonging to the Salaminians did the same as the
Curians. Consequently the Persians became superior to the
Cyprians. The army was put to flight, many fell, and amongst
them Onesilus, and the king of the Solians, Aristocyprus, son of
the Philocyprus whom Solon the Athenian, when he visited
Cyprus, celebrated in his verses above all tyrants. The Amathusians
cut off the head of Onesilus, because he had besieged them,
took it to Amathus, and suspended it over the gates; and when
the head had become hollow, a swarm of bees entered it, and
filled it with honey-comb. An answer was given to the Amathusians,
who consulted the oracle respecting it, "that they should
take down the head and bury it, and sacrifice annually to Onesilus,
as to a hero, and that it would turn out better for them."</p>

<p>Afterward, the Persians crossed the Mæander and engaged
the Carians on the banks of the river Marsyas. They fought an
obstinate battle, and at last overpowered them. Of the Persians
there fell about two thousand, and of the Carians ten thousand.
The Carians, however, afterward recovered from this wound, and
renewed the contest. For hearing that the Persians designed to
invade their cities, they placed an ambuscade on the way to
Pedasus, into which the Persians, falling by night, were cut in
pieces, with their generals Daurises, Amorges, and Sisamaces.</p>

<p>Hymees, who was one of those who pursued the Ionians that
had attacked Sardis, bending his march toward the Propontis, took
Cius of Mysia. When he heard that Daurises had quitted the
Hellespont, and was marching against Caria, he abandoned the
Propontis, and led his army on the Hellespont. He subdued all
the Æolians who inhabited the territory of Ilium, and subdued the
Gergithæ, the remaining descendants of the ancient Teucrians.
Just then, however, he died of disease in the Troad. But Artaphernes,
governor of Sardis, and Otanes, who were appointed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
invade Ionia and the neighboring territory of Æolia, took Clazomenæ
and Cyme.</p>

<p>Aristagoras the Milesian, for he was not, as it proved, a man
of strong courage, after he had thus thrown Ionia into confusion, and
raised great disturbances, thought of flight, when he saw these results.
Besides, it appeared to him impossible to overcome King
Darius; so calling his partisans together, he suggested "that it
would be better for them to have some sure place of refuge, in
case they should be expelled from Miletus." He asked, therefore,
whether he should lead them to Sardinia, to found a colony, or to
Myrcinus of the Edonians, which Histiæus had begun to fortify,
having received it as a gift from Darius. However, the opinion of
Hecatæus the historian, son of Hegesander, was, that they should
set out for neither of these places, but should build a fortress in the
island of Leros, and remain quiet, if they were compelled to quit
Miletus. But Aristagoras himself was decidedly in favor of proceeding
to Myrcinus; he therefore intrusted Miletus to Pythagoras,
a citizen of distinction, and, taking with him all who were willing,
sailed to Thrace, and took possession of the region to which he
was bound. But both Aristagoras himself and all his army perished
while he was laying siege to a city in Thrace.</p>

<h2><i>BOOK VI. ERATO.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE SUPPRESSION OF THE IONIAN REVOLT.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristagoras</span> thus induced the Ionians to revolt, and died; and
Histiæus, tyrant of Miletus, repaired to Sardis. When he arrived
from Susa, Artaphernes, Governor of Sardis, asked him for what
reason he supposed the Ionians had revolted. Histiæus said he
did not know, and seemed surprised at what had happened, as if
he knew nothing of the present state of affairs. But Artaphernes
saw that he was dissembling, and being aware of the exact truth
as to the revolt, said: "Histiæus, the state of the case is this: you
made the shoe and Aristagoras has put it on." Histiæus in alarm
fled to the coast as soon as night came on, and although he had
promised to reduce the great island of Sardinia for Darius, he insinuated
himself into the command of the Ionians in the war
against him. At Chios he was taken and put in chains, being suspected
by the Chians of planning some new design against them
in favor of Darius. However, the Chians, being assured that he
was an enemy to the king, released him, and conveyed him to
Miletus, at his own request; but the Milesians, delighted at being
rid of Aristagoras, were by no means desirous to receive another
tyrant into their country, as they had tasted of freedom. Thereupon
Histiæus, going down to Miletus by night, endeavored to
enter it by force, but was wounded in the thigh by one of the
Milesians. When he was repulsed from his own country, he went
back to Chios, and from there, since he could not persuade the
Chians to help him, he crossed over to Mitylene, and prevailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
with the Lesbians to furnish him with ships; they manned eight
triremes, and sailed with Histiæus to Byzantium. There taking
up their station, they took all the ships that sailed out of the
Pontus, except such of them as said they were ready to submit to
Histiæus.</p>

<p>But a large naval and land-force was expected against Miletus
itself. For the Persian generals had united their forces and
formed one camp to march to Miletus, deeming the other cities of
less consequence. The Ionians, hearing of this, sent their respective
deputies to the Panionium, and determined not to assemble
any land-forces to oppose the Persians; but bade the
Milesians themselves defend their walls, while they should man
their navy, without leaving a single ship behind, and assemble as
soon as possible at Lade, to fight in defence of Miletus. Lade is
a small island lying off the city of the Milesians. Soon the Ionians
came up with their ships manned, and formed their line, a fleet
three hundred and fifty-three triremes strong. On the side of the
barbarians the number of ships amounted to six hundred, and when
they arrived on the Milesian coast, and all their land-forces had
come up, the Persian generals began to fear they should not be
strong enough to overcome them, and so should be also unable to
take Miletus, since they were not masters at sea, and then might
be in danger of receiving punishment at the hands of Darius.
Taking these things into consideration, they summoned the tyrants
of the Ionians, who had been deprived of their governments by
Aristagoras, and had fled to the Medes, and who happened at that
time to be serving in the army against Miletus. "Men of Ionia,"
they said, "let each of you now show his zeal for the king's house.
For let each of you endeavor to detach his own countrymen from
the rest of the confederacy, and proclaim this, that they shall suffer
no hurt on account of their rebellion, nor shall their buildings,
whether sacred or profane, be burnt, nor shall they be treated with
more severity than they were before. But if they do not do this,
and will at all events come to the hazard of a battle, threaten that,
when conquered in battle, they shall all be enslaved." And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
tyrants of the Ionians sent each by night to his own countrymen,
to make known the warning. But the Ionians to whom these
messages came, continued firm to their purpose and would not
listen to treachery; for each thought that the Persians had sent
this message.</p>

<p>When the Ionians had assembled at Lade, a council was held,
and the Phocæan general Dionysius spoke as follows: "Our affairs
are in a critical<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
state, O Ionians; we are to be freemen or
slaves, and that too run-away slaves. But if you are willing to
undergo hardships, for the present you will have to toil, but will be
enabled, by overcoming your enemies, to be free; on the other
hand, if you abandon yourselves to ease and disorder, I have no
hope that you will escape punishment at the hands of the king for
your revolt. But be persuaded by me, and entrust yourselves to
my guidance, and I promise you, that if the gods are impartial,
either our enemies will not fight us at all, or if they do fight with
us, they will be completely beaten." The Ionians intrusted themselves
to the guidance of Dionysius without hesitation who daily
led out the ships into a line, exercised the rowers, by practising the
manœuvre of cutting through one another's line, put the marines
under arms, and kept the ships at anchor for the rest of the day.
For seven days they continued to obey, but on the eighth the
Ionians, unaccustomed to such toil, and worn down by hardships
and the heat of the sun, grumbled to each other in such terms as
these: "What deity have we offended to fill up this measure of
affliction? we who were so beside ourselves, as to have intrusted
ourselves to the guidance of a presumptuous Phocæan, who, all
told, contributed only three ships, but having got us under his control,
afflicts us with intolerable hardships. Many of us have already
fallen into distempers, and many more must expect to meet
with the same fate. Instead of these evils, it would be better for us
to suffer anything else, and to endure the impending servitude, be it
what it may, than be oppressed by the present, Come, let us no
longer obey him." And from that moment no one would obey;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
but, pitching their tents on the island, they continued under the
shade, and would not go on board the ships, or perform their exercise.
When the generals of the Samians observed what was
passing among the Ionians, and saw great disorder among them,
they accepted the proposal of Æaces, son of Syloson, which he had
before sent them at the desire of the Persians, exhorting them to
abandon the confederacy of the Ionians. Besides, it was clearly
impossible for them to overcome the power of the king, because
they were convinced, that if they should overcome Darius with his
present fleet, another five times as large would come against them.
So laying hold of this pretext, as soon as they saw the Ionians refusing
to behave well, they deemed it for their advantage to preserve
their own buildings, sacred and profane.</p>

<p>When therefore the Phœnicians sailed against them, the
Ionians drew out their ships in line to oppose them; but when
they came near and opposed each other, I am unable to affirm with
certainty who of the Ionians proved themselves cowards, or brave
men, in this sea-fight; for they mutually accuse each other. The
Samians however are said at that moment to have hoisted sail, in
pursuance of their agreement with Æaces, and steered out of the
line to Samos, with the exception of eleven ships; the captains of
which stayed and fought, refusing to obey their commanders; and
for this action the commonwealth of the Samians conferred upon
them the honor of having their names and ancestry engraved on a
column, as those who had proved themselves valiant men; and
this column now stands in the forum. The Lesbians also, seeing
those stationed next them flee, did the same as the Samians; and
most of the Ionians followed their example. Of those that persisted
in the battle, the Chians were most roughly handled, as they
displayed signal proofs of valor, and would not act as cowards.
They had contributed one hundred ships, and on board each of
them forty chosen citizens served as marines; and though they
saw most of the confederates abandoning the common cause, they
disdained to follow the example of their treachery; but choosing
rather to remain with the few allies, they continued the fight, cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
through the enemies' line, until, after they had taken many of
the enemies' ships, they lost most of their own. The Chians then
fled to their own country with the remainder of their fleet. Those
Chians whose ships were disabled in the fight, took refuge in Mycale,
ran their ships aground, and left them there, and marched
over-land across the continent. On their return they entered the
territory of Ephesus, and arrived near the city by night, at a time
when the women were celebrating the Thesmophoria; thereupon,
the Ephesians, not having before heard how it had fared with the
Chians, and seeing an army enter their territory, thinking they
were certainly robbers, and had come to seize their women, rushed
out in a body, and slew the Chians. When Dionysius the Phocæan
perceived that the affairs of the Ionians were utterly ruined, he took
three of the enemies' ships and sailed away, not indeed to Phocæa,
well knowing that it would be enslaved with the rest of Ionia, but
directly to Phœnicia; and there having disabled some merchantmen,
and obtained great wealth, he sailed to Sicily, where he established
himself as a pirate, attacking none of the Greeks, but
only Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians.</p>

<p>When the Persians had conquered the Ionians in the sea-fight
they besieged Miletus by land and sea, undermined the walls, and
bringing up all kinds of military engines against it, took it completely,
in the sixth year after the revolt of Aristagoras. They reduced
the city to slavery, so that the event coincided with the
oracle delivered concerning Miletus. For when the Argives consulted
the oracle at Delphi respecting the preservation of their
city, a double answer was given; part concerning themselves, and
the addition concerning the Milesians. The part relating to the
Argives I will mention when I come to that part of the history;
the words the Pythian uttered relative to the Milesians, who were
not present, were these: "Then Miletus, contriver of wicked
deeds, thou shalt become a feast and a rich gift to many: thy
wives shall wash the feet of many long-haired masters, and our
temple at Didymi shall be tended by others." These things befell
the Milesians at that time; for most of the men were killed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
Persians, who wear long hair, their women and children were
treated as slaves, and the sacred enclosure at Didymi, both the
temple and the shrine, were pillaged and burnt. Of the riches in
this temple I have frequently made mention in other parts of my
history. Such of the Milesians as were taken alive were afterward
conveyed to Susa; and King Darius did them no harm, but settled
them on the Red Sea, in the city of Ampe, near by which the Tigris
falls into the sea. Of the Milesian territory, the Persians
themselves retained the parts round the city and the plain; the
mountainous parts they gave to the Carians of Pedasus to occupy.
When the Milesians suffered this at the hands of the Persians, the
Sybarites, who inhabited Laos and Scydrus, did not show equal
sympathy. But when Sybaris was taken by the Crotonians, all
the Milesians of every age had shaved their heads and displayed
marks of deep mourning: for these two cities had been more
strictly united in friendship than any others we are acquainted with.
The Athenians behaved in a very different manner; for the
Athenians made it evident that they were excessively grieved at the
capture of Miletus, both in many other ways, and more particularly
when Phrynichus had composed a drama of the capture of Miletus,
and represented it, the whole theatre burst into tears, and fined
him a thousand drachmas<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span>
for renewing the memory of their domestic
misfortunes; and they gave order that henceforth no one
should act this drama.</p>

While Histiæus the Milesian was near Byzantium, intercepting
the trading ships of the Ionians that sailed out of the Pontus, news
was brought him of what had taken place at Miletus; he therefore
intrusted his affairs on the Hellespont to Bisaltes, son of Apollophanes,
of Abydos, and with the Lesbians sailed to Chios, and
engaged with a garrison of Chians, that would not admit him, at a
place called Cœli in the Chian territory, and killed great numbers
of them. The deity is wont to give some previous warning when
any great calamities are about to befall city or nation, and before
these misfortunes great warnings happened to the Chians. For in
the first place, when they sent to Delphi a band of one hundred
youths, two only of them returned home, for a pestilence seized
and carried off the remaining ninety-eight. In the next place, a
little before the sea-fight, a house in the city fell in upon some
boys, as they were learning to read, so that of one hundred and
twenty boys one only escaped. After this, the sea-fight following,
threw the city prostrate; and after the sea-fight Histiæus with the
Lesbians came upon them; and as the Chians had been much
shattered, he easily reduced them to subjection. From there Histiæus
proceeded to attack Thasus with a large body of Ionians and
Æolians; and while he was besieging Thasus, Harpagus, the
Persian, general of a considerable army, who, happening to be in
those parts, engaged with him after his landing, took Histiæus
himself prisoner, and destroyed the greater part of his army.</p>

<p>Now if, when Histiæus was taken prisoner, he had been conducted
to king Darius, in my opinion, he would have suffered no
punishment, and the king would have forgiven him his fault. But
for this very reason, lest by escaping he should again regain his
influence with the king, Artaphernes, Governor of Sardis, and
Harpagus, who received him as soon as he was conducted to
Sardis, impaled his body on the spot, and embalmed the head and
sent it to Darius at Susa. Darius blamed those that had done it,
because they had not brought him alive into his presence, and
gave orders that they should wash and adorn the head of Histiæus,
and inter it honorably, as the remains of a man who had been a
great benefactor to himself and the Persians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
The naval force of the Persians wintered near Miletus. In the
second year it set sail for the islands lying near the continent,
Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos, which it easily subdued. When they
took any one of these islands, the barbarians netted the inhabitants
in this manner: Taking one another by the hand, they
would extend from the northern to the southern sea, and so march
over the island, hunting out the inhabitants. They also took the
Ionian cities on the continent with the same ease; but did not net
the inhabitants, for that was impossible. Thus the Ionians were
for the third time reduced to slavery; first by the Lydians, then
twice successively by the Persians. The naval force, departing
from Ionia, reduced all the places on the left of the Hellespont as
one sails in; and all the cities of the Chersonese, except Cardia,
they subdued.</p>

<p>Till that time Miltiades, son of Cimon, was tyrant of these
cities, Miltiades, son of Cypselus, having formally acquired this
government in the following manner: The Thracian Dolonci possessed
this Chersonese; these Dolonci, being pressed in war by
the Apsynthians, sent their kings to Delphi to consult the oracle
concerning the war; the Pythian answered them, "that they
should take that man with them to their country to found a colony,
who after their departure from the temple should first offer them
hospitality." Accordingly the Dolonci, going by the sacred way,
went through the territories of the Phocians and Bœotians, and
when no one invited them, turned out of the road toward Athens.
At that time Pisistratus had the supreme power at Athens; but
Miltiades, son of Cypselus, had considerable influence; he was of
a family that maintained horses for the chariot-races, and was
originally descended from Æacus and Ægina, but in later times
was an Athenian, Philæus, son of Ajax, having been the first
Athenian of that family. This Miltiades, being seated in his own
portico, and seeing the Dolonci passing by, wearing a dress not
belonging to the country, and carrying javelins, called out to them:
and upon their coming to him, he offered them shelter and hospitality.
They, grateful for their entertainment, made known to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
the whole oracle, and entreated him to obey the deity. Their
words persuaded Miltiades as soon as he heard them, for he was
troubled with the government of Pisistratus, and desired to get
out of his way. He therefore immediately set out to Delphi to
ask the oracle whether he should do that which the Dolonci requested
of him. The Pythian having bade him do so, Miltiades
took with him all such Athenians as were willing to join in the expedition,
and set sail with the Dolonci, and took possession of the
country; and they who introduced him appointed him tyrant. He,
first of all, built a wall on the isthmus of the Chersonese, from the
city of Cardia to Pactya, in order that the Apsynthians might not
be able to injure them by making incursions into their country.
The width of this isthmus is thirty-six stades; and from this
isthmus the whole Chersonese inward is four hundred and twenty
stades in length. Miltiades next made war upon the Lampsacenians,
who laid an ambush and took him prisoner. But Miltiades
was well known to Crœsus, who, on hearing of this event, sent and
commanded the Lampsacenians to release Miltiades; if not, he
threatened that he would destroy them like a pine-tree. The
Lampsacenians, uncertain as to what was the meaning of this saying,
discovered, with some difficulty, from one of the elders, that
the pine alone of all trees, when cut down, does not send forth any
more shoots, but perishes entirely: whereupon the Lampsacenians,
dreading the power of Crœsus, set Miltiades at liberty. He
accordingly escaped by means of Crœsus, and afterward died childless,
having bequeathed the government and his property to Stesagoras,
his brother by the same mother. When he was dead the
Chersonesians sacrificed to him, as is usual to a founder, and instituted
equestrian and gymnastic exercises, in which no Lampsacenian
is permitted to contend. The war with the Lampsacenians
still continuing, it also befell Stesagoras to die childless; being
struck on the head with an axe in the prytaneum, by a man who
in pretence was a deserter, but was in fact an enemy, and a very
vehement one.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Stesagoras, the Pisistratidæ sent Miltiades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
son of Cimon, and brother of Stesagoras who had died, with one
ship to the Chersonese, to assume the government; they had also
treated him with kindness at Athens, as if they had not been
parties to the death of his father Cimon. Miltiades having arrived
in the Chersonese, kept himself at home under color of honoring
the memory of his brother Stesagoras, and the principal
persons of all the cities assembled together from every
quarter, and came in a body with the intention of condoling with
him, whereupon they were all thrown into chains by him. Thus
Miltiades got possession of the Chersonese, maintaining five hundred
auxiliaries, and married Hegesipyle, daughter of Olorus, King
of the Thracians. This Miltiades, son of Cimon, had lately arrived
in the Chersonese, but having heard that the Phœnicians were at
Tenedos, he loaded five triremes with the property he had at hand,
and sailed away for Athens. But when he had set out from the
city of Cardia, he sailed through the gulf of Melas, and as he was
passing by the Chersonese, the Phœnicians fell in with his ships.
Miltiades himself escaped with four of the ships to Imbrus, but the
fifth the Phœnicians pursued and took; of this ship, Metiochus, the
eldest of the sons of Miltiades, happened to be commander, whom
the Phœnicians took together with the ship. When they heard
that he was son of Miltiades, they took him up to the king,
thinking that they should obtain great favor for themselves, because
Miltiades had given an opinion to the Ionians advising them
to comply with the Scythians, when the Scythians requested them
to loose the bridge and return to their own country. But Darius
did the young man no injury, but many favors; for he gave him a
house and an estate, and a Persian wife, by whom he had children,
who were reckoned among the Persians. Meantime Miltiades
arrived safely at Athens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning of the spring, the other generals were dismissed
by the king, but Mardonius, son of Gobryas, went down to
the coast, taking with him a very large land-army, and a numerous
naval force: he was young in years, and had lately married king
Darius' daughter, Artazostra. When he arrived in Cilicia, and
had gone in person on board ship, he proceeded with the rest of the
fleet, while the other generals led the land-army to the Hellespont.
When Mardonius reached Ionia, he did a thing, which, when I
mention it, will be a matter of very great astonishment to those
Greeks, who cannot believe that Otanes, one of the seven Persians,
gave an opinion that it was right for the Persians to be governed
by a democracy; for Mardonius deposed the tyrants of the Ionians,
and established democracies in the cities.</p>

<p>After this, Darius made trial of what were the intentions of the
Greeks, whether to make war with him or to deliver themselves
up. He therefore despatched heralds, appointing different persons
to go to different parts throughout Greece, with orders to ask
earth and water for the king, the Persian method of demanding
submission. These he sent to Greece, and despatched other heralds
to the tributary cities on the coast, with orders to build ships
of war and transports for horses. To the heralds who came to
Greece many of the inhabitants of the continent gave what the
Persian demanded, as did all the islanders also, and moreover the
Æginetæ, whereupon the Athenians forthwith threatened them,
thinking that the Æginetæ had given earth and water out of ill-will
toward themselves, in order that they might make war on
them in conjunction with the Persian. And the Athenians laying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
hold of the pretext, sent to Sparta to accuse the Æginetæ of what
they had done as betraying Greece.</p>

<p>The Spartans say, that once upon a time there lived in Lacedæmon
one Glaucus, son of Epicydes. This man attained to the
first rank in all respects, and bore the highest character for justice
of all who at that time dwelt at Lacedæmon. In the course of
time a certain Milesian came to Sparta and wished to have a conference
with him, and said: "I am a Milesian, and have come,
Glaucus, with the desire of profiting by your justice, of which,
throughout all the rest of Greece, and particularly in Ionia, there
is great talk. Ionia is so continually exposed to great dangers,
while with us one can never see the same persons retaining
property. Having, therefore, reflected and deliberated on these
things, I determined to change half of my whole substance into
silver and deposit it with you, being well assured that with you, it
would be safe. Do you, then, take this money, and preserve these
tokens; and whosoever possessing these shall demand it back
again, restore it to him." So spoke the stranger who came from
Miletus, and Glaucus received the deposit, on the condition mentioned.
After a long time had elapsed, the sons of this man who
had deposited the money came to Sparta, and addressed themselves
to Glaucus, showed the tokens, and demanded back the
money. Glaucus repulsed them, answering as follows: "I don't
remember the matter, nor any of the circumstances you mention;
but if I can recall it to my mind, I am willing to do every thing that
is just; if I really received it, I wish to restore it correctly; but if
I have not received it at all, I shall have recourse to the laws of
the Greeks against you. I therefore defer settling this matter with
you for four months from the present time." The Milesians in disappointment
departed, taking greatly to heart the loss of their
money. But Glaucus went to Delphi to consult the oracle; and,
when he asked the oracle whether he should make a booty of the
money by an oath, the Pythian assailed him in the following words:
"Glaucus, son of Epicydes, thus to prevail by an oath, and to make
a booty of the money, will be a present gain. But there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
nameless son of Perjury, who has neither hands nor feet; he
pursues swiftly, until he has seized and destroyed the whole
race, and all the house of him who has falsely sworn. But the
race of a man who keeps his oath is afterward more blessed."
Glaucus, hearing this, entreated the god to pardon the words he
had spoken. But the Pythian said, that to tempt the god, and to
commit the crime, were the same thing. So Glaucus sent for the
Milesian strangers, and restored them the money. There is at
present not a single descendant of Glaucus, nor any house which
is supposed to have belonged to Glaucus; but he is utterly extirpated
from Sparta. Thus it is right to have no other thought
concerning a deposit, than to restore it when it is demanded.</p>

    <p>RUINS OF AN ANCIENT TEMPLE IN CORINTH.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Æginetæ, offended at what they considered a great affront,
prepared to revenge themselves on the Athenians: and as the
Athenians happened to have a five-benched galley at Sunium,
they formed an ambuscade and took the ship "Theoris"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
filled with the principal Athenians, and put the men in chains. The
Athenians, thus treated by the Æginetæ, no longer delayed to devise
all sorts of plans against them. Now there was in Ægina an
eminent man named Nicodromus, son of Cnœthus; incensed
against the Æginetæ on account of his former banishment from
the island, and now hearing that the Athenians were preparing to
do a mischief to the Æginetæ, he entered into an agreement with
the Athenians for the betrayal of Ægina, mentioning on what day
he would make the attempt, and on what it would be necessary
for them to come to his assistance. Nicodromus, according to his
agreement, on the appointed day seized that which is called the
old town. The Athenians, however, did not arrive at the proper
time, for they happened not to have a sufficient number of ships
to engage with the Æginetæ; and while they were entreating the
Corinthians to furnish them with ships, their plan was ruined. The
Corinthians, for they were then on very friendly terms with them, at
their request supplied the Athenians with twenty ships, hiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
them out at a nominal price of five drachmæ each; because by their
laws they were forbidden to give them for nothing. The Athenians,
taking these and their own, manned seventy ships in all,
sailed to Ægina, and arrived one day after that agreed upon.
When the Athenians did not arrive at the proper time, Nicodromus
embarked on shipboard and made his escape from Ægina;
and others of the Æginetæ accompanied him, to whom the Athenians
gave Sunium for a habitation; and they, sallying from thence,
plundered the Æginetæ in the island. This, however, happened
subsequently. In the meantime the most wealthy of the Æginetæ
overpowered the common people, who, together with Nicodromus,
had revolted against them, and led them out to execution. On
this occasion they incurred a guilt, which they were unable to expiate
by any contrivance, as they were ejected out of the island
before the goddess became propitious to them. For having taken
seven hundred of the common people prisoners, they led them
out to execution; and one of them, who escaped from his bonds,
fled to the porch of Ceres the lawgiver, and seizing the door-handle,
held it fast; when they were unable by dragging to tear
him away, they cut off his hands, and so took him away; and the
hands were left sticking on the door-handles. So did the Æginetæ
treat their own people. But when the Athenians arrived with
their seventy ships, they came to an engagement, and being conquered
in the sea-fight, they called upon the same persons as before
for assistance, that is, on the Argives. They, however, would
not any longer succor them, but complained that the ships of the
Æginetæ, having been forcibly seized by Cleomenes, had touched
on the territory of Argos, and the crews had disembarked with the
Lacedæmonians. Some men had also disembarked from Sicyonian
ships in the same invasion; and a penalty was imposed upon them
by the Argives, to pay a thousand talents, five hundred each.
The Sicyonians, acknowledging that they had acted unjustly, made
an agreement to pay one hundred talents, and be free from the
rest; but the Æginetæ would not own themselves in the wrong,
and were very obstinate. On this account, therefore, none of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
Argives were sent by the commonwealth to assist them; but, on
their request, volunteers went to the number of a thousand; a
general, whose name was Eurybates, and who had practised for
the pentathlon, led them. The greater number of these never returned
home, but were slain by the Athenians in Ægina. The
general, Eurybates, engaging in single combat, killed three several
antagonists in that manner, but was slain by the fourth, Sophanes
of Decelea. But the Æginetæ attacked the fleet of the Athenians
when they were in disorder, and obtained a victory, and took
four of their ships with the men on board.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>EXPEDITION OF DATIS AND ARTAPHERNES; THE BATTLE OF MARATHON.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">War</span> was accordingly kindled between the Athenians and
Æginetæ. But the Persian pursued his own design, for the servant
continually reminded him to remember the Athenians, and
the Pisistratidæ constantly importuned him and accused the Athenians;
and at the same time Darius was desirous of subduing those
people of Greece who had refused to give him earth and water. He
therefore dismissed Mardonius from his command, because he had
succeeded ill in his expedition; and appointed other generals,
whom he sent against Eretria and Athens, namely, Datis, who was
a Mede by birth, and Artaphernes, son of Artaphernes, his own
nephew; and he despatched them with strict orders to enslave
Athens and Eretria, and bring the bondsmen into his presence.
When these generals who were appointed left the king, and
reached the Aleian plain of Cilicia, bringing with them a numerous
and well-equipped army, they encamped there until the whole
naval force required from each people came up: the horse-transports
were also present, which Darius in the preceding year had
commanded his tributaries to prepare. They put the horses on
board of these, and embarked the land-forces in the ships, and
sailed for Ionia with six hundred triremes. From there they did
not steer their ships along the continent direct to the Hellespont
and Thrace; but parting from Samos they bent their course
across the Icarian sea, and through the islands, dreading the circumnavigation
of Athos, because in the preceding year, in attempting
a passage that way, they had sustained great loss.</p>

<p>While they were doing this, the Delians also, abandoning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
Delos, fled to Tenos; but as the fleet was sailing down toward it,
Datis would not permit the ships to anchor near the island, but
further on, off Rhenea; and he, having ascertained where the
Delians were, sent a herald and addressed them as follows:
"Sacred men, why have you fled, forming an unfavorable opinion
of me? For both I myself have so much wisdom, and am so
ordered by the king, that in the region where the two deities<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>
were born, no harm should be done either to the country itself or
its inhabitants. Return, therefore, to your houses, and resume
possession of the island." This message he sent to the Delians
by means of a herald; and afterward heaped up three hundred
talents of frankincense upon the altar, and burnt it. Then Datis
sailed with the army first against Eretria, taking with him both
Ionians and Æolians. But after he had put out to sea from there,
Delos was shaken by an earthquake, as the Delians say, the first
and last time that it was ever so affected. And the deity assuredly
by this portent intimated to men the evils that were about to befall
them. For during the three successive reigns of Darius, son of
Hystaspes, of Xerxes, son of Darius, and of Artaxerxes, son of
Xerxes, more disasters befell Greece than during the twenty generations
that preceded the time of Darius, partly brought upon it
by the Persians, and partly by the chief men amongst them contending
for power. So that it is not at all improbable that Delos
should be moved at that time, though until then unmoved; and in
an oracle respecting it, it had been thus written: "I will move
even Delos, although hitherto unmoved." And in the Greek
language these names mean: Darius, "one who restrains";
Xerxes, "a warrior"; and Artaxerxes, "a mighty warrior."</p>

<p>After the barbarians had parted from Delos, and touched at
the islands, they took with them men to serve in the army, and
carried away the sons of the islanders for hostages. Having subdued
Eretria, and rested a few days, they sailed to Attica, pressing
the inhabitants very close, and expecting to treat them in the same
way as they had the Eretrians. Now as Marathon was the spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
in Attica best adapted for cavalry, and nearest to Eretria, they
gathered their forces there. When the Athenians heard of this,
they also sent their forces to Marathon: and ten generals led
them, of whom the tenth was Miltiades, whose father, Cimon, had
been banished from Athens by Pisistratus. During his exile, it was
his good fortune to obtain the Olympic prize in the four-horse chariot
race, the honor of which victory he transferred to Miltiades, his
brother by the same mother; afterward, in the next Olympiad,
being victorious with the same mares, he permitted Pisistratus to
be proclaimed victor, and returned home under terms. But after
he had gained a third Olympic prize with the same mares, it happened
that he died by the hands of the sons of Pisistratus, when
Pisistratus himself was no longer alive; they slew him near the
Prytaneum, having placed men to waylay him by night. Cimon
was buried in front of the city, beyond that which is called the
road to Cœla, and opposite him these same mares were buried,
which won the three Olympic prizes. Stesagoras, the elder son
of Cimon, was at that time being educated by his uncle in the
Chersonese, but the younger by Cimon himself at Athens, and he
had the name of Miltiades, from Miltiades, the founder of the
Chersonese. At that time, then, this Miltiades, coming from the
Chersonese, and having escaped a twofold death, became general
of the Athenians; for in the first place, the Phœnicians pursued
him as far as Imbros, exceedingly desirous of seizing him and carrying
him up to the king; and in the next, when he had escaped
them, and had returned to his own country, and thought himself
in safety, his enemies attacked him, and brought him before a court
of justice, to prosecute him for tyranny in the Chersonese. These
also he escaped, and was at length appointed general of the
Athenians by the choice of the people.</p>

<p>And first, while the generals were yet in the city, they despatched
a herald to Sparta, one Phidippides, an Athenian, a courier
by profession, who arrived in Sparta on the following day after his
departure from the city of the Athenians, and on coming in presence
of the magistrates, said: "Lacedæmonians, the Athenians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
entreat you to assist them, and not to suffer the most ancient city
among the Greeks to fall into bondage to barbarians; for Eretria
is already reduced to slavery, and Greece has become weaker by
the loss of a renowned city." He delivered the message according
to his instructions, and they resolved to assist the Athenians;
but it was out of their power to do so immediately, as they were
unwilling to violate the law; for it was the ninth day of the current
month; and they said they could not march out until the moon's
circle should be full.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the traitor Hippias, son of Pisistratus, had guided
the barbarians to Marathon. He first of all landed the slaves from
Eretria on the island of the Styreans, called Ægilia; and next he
moored the ships as they came to Marathon, and drew up the barbarians
as they disembarked on land. But as he was busied in
doing this, it happened that he sneezed and coughed more violently
than he was accustomed; and as he was far advanced in years,
several of his teeth were loose, so that through the violence of his
cough he threw out one of these teeth. It fell on the sand, and
he used every endeavor to find it; but when the tooth could
nowhere be found, he drew a deep sigh, and said to the bystanders:
"This country is not ours, nor shall we be able to subdue
it; whatever share belongeth to me, my tooth possesses."</p>

<p>When the Athenians were drawn up in a place sacred to Hercules,
the Platæans came to their assistance with all their forces.
For the Platæans had given themselves up to the Athenians, as
the Athenians had already undergone many toils on their account.</p>

<p>The opinions of the Athenian generals were divided: one party
not consenting to engage, "because they were too few to engage
with the army of the Medes"; and the others, among whom was
Miltiades, urging them to give battle. There was an eleventh
voter who was appointed minister of war among the Athenians,
who had an equal vote with the generals, and at that time Callimachus
of Aphidnæ was minister of war. To him Miltiades came
and spoke as follows: "It now depends on you, Callimachus,
either to enslave Athens, or, by preserving its liberty, to leave a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
memorial of yourself to every age, such as not even Harmodius
and Aristogeiton have left. For the Athenians were never in so
great danger from the time they were first a people. If they succumb
to the Medes, it has been determined what they are to suffer
when delivered up to Hippias; but if the city survives, it will become
the first of the Greek cities. How, then, this can be brought
to pass, and how the power of deciding the matter depends on you,
I will now proceed to explain. The opinions of us generals, who
are ten, are equally divided; the one party urging that we should
engage, the other that we should not. Now, if we do not engage,
I expect that some great dissension arising amongst us will shake
the minds of the Athenians so as to induce them to a compliance
with the Medes. But if we engage before any dastardly thought
arises in the minds of some of the Athenians, if the gods are
impartial, we shall be able to get the better in the engagement.
All these things now entirely depend on you. For if you will support
my opinion, your country will be free, and the city the first in
Greece; but if you join with those who would dissuade us from an
engagement, the contrary of the advantages I have enumerated
will fall to your lot." Miltiades, by these words, gained over Callimachus,
and it was determined to engage. Afterward the generals
whose opinions had been given to engage, as the command
for the day devolved upon each of them, gave it up to Miltiades;
but though he accepted it, he would not come to an engagement
before his own turn to command came.</p>

<p>The war-minister, Callimachus, commanded the right wing, for
the law at that time was so settled among the Athenians; the Platæans
were drawn out last of all, occupying the left wing. Now,
ever since that battle, when the Athenians offer sacrifices and celebrate
the public festivals which take place every five years, the
Athenian herald prays, saying: "May blessings attend both the
Athenians and the Platæans." Their line was equal in extent to
the Medic line, but the middle of it was but few deep, and there
the line was weakest, while each wing was strong in numbers.
When they were drawn up, and the victims were favorable, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
Athenians, at the order to charge, advanced against the barbarians
in double-quick time; and the space between them was not less
than eight stades. The Persians, seeing them charging at full
speed, prepared to receive them, laughing at their madness when
they saw that they were so few in number, and that they rushed on
at full speed without cavalry or archers. The Athenians, however,
when they engaged in close ranks with the barbarians, fought in a
manner worthy of record. For they, the first of all the Greeks
whom we know of, charged the enemy at full speed, and first endured
the sight of the Medic garb and the men that wore it; for
until that time the very name of the Medes was a terror to the
Greeks. The battle at Marathon lasted a long time: and in the
middle of the line, where the Persians themselves and the Sacæ
were arrayed, the barbarians were victorious, and having broken
the line, pursued to the interior; but in both wings the Athenians
and the Platæans were victorious. Here they allowed the defeated
portion of the barbarians to flee; and having united both wings,
they fought with those who had broken their centre until at last
the Athenians were victorious. They followed the Persians in
their flight, cutting them to pieces, till, reaching the shore, they
called for fire and attacked the ships.</p>

<p>In this battle the brave war-minister, Callimachus, was killed,
and among the generals, Stesilaus, son of Thrasylas, perished;
Cynægeirus, son of Euphorion, laid hold of a ship's stern and had
his hand severed by an axe and fell; and besides, many other
distinguished Athenians were slain. In this manner the Athenians
made themselves masters of seven ships: but with the rest the
barbarians rowed rapidly back, and after taking off the Eretrian
slaves from the island in which they had left them, sailed round
Sunium, wishing to anticipate the Athenians in reaching the
city. But the Athenians marched with all speed to the assistance
of the city, and reached it before the barbarians arrived; and
as they had come from the precinct of Hercules at Marathon, they
took up their station in another precinct of Hercules at Cynosarges.
The barbarians, having laid to with their fleet off Phalerum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
for a time, soon sailed away for Asia. In this battle at
Marathon there died of the barbarians about six thousand four
hundred men; and of the Athenians, one hundred and ninety-two.
An Athenian, Epizelus, son of Cuphagoras, while fighting in the
medley, and behaving valiantly, was deprived of sight, though
wounded in no part of his body, nor struck from a distance; and
he continued to be blind from that time for the remainder of his
life. I have heard that he used to give the following account
of his loss. He thought that a large heavy-armed man stood before
him, whose beard shaded the whole of his shield; that this
spectre passed by him, and killed the man that stood by his side,
smiting him with this loss as it passed.</p>

<p>King Darius, before the Eretrians were made captive, harbored
a deep resentment against them, as the Eretrians had been the
first to begin acts of injustice: but when he saw them brought into
his presence, and subject to his power, he did them no other harm,
but settled them in the Cissian territory at a station of his own, the
name of which is Ardericca; it is two hundred and ten stades distant
from Susa, and forty from the well which produces three different
substances; for asphalt, salt, and oil are drawn up from it,
in the following manner. It is pumped up by means of a swipe,
and, instead of a bucket, half of a wine-skin is attached to it; having
dipped down with this, a man draws it up and then pours the contents
into a receiver; and being poured from this into another, it
assumes three different forms: the asphalt and the salt immediately
become solid, but the oil they collect, and the Persians call it
rhadinace; it is black and emits a strong odor. Here king Darius
settled the Eretrians; who, even to my time, occupied this territory,
retaining their ancient language. Two thousand of the
Lacedæmonians came to Athens after the full moon, making such
haste to be in time, that they arrived in Attica on the third day
after leaving Sparta. Too late for the battle, they, nevertheless,
proceeded to Marathon, saw the slain, commended the Athenians
and their achievement, and returned home.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the Persians at Marathon, Miltiades, asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
of the Athenians seventy ships, and troops, and money, without
telling them what country he purposed to invade, but saying that
he would make them rich if they would follow him, for he would
take them to a country, from which they would easily bring an
abundance of gold, and the Athenians, elated by these hopes,
granted the ships. Miltiades, accordingly took the troops and
sailed against Paros, alleging as a pretext, that the Parians had
first begun hostilities by sending a trireme with the Persians to
Marathon. But his real reason was that he had a grudge against
the Parians on account of Lysagoras, son of Tisias, who was
a Parian by birth and who had calumniated him to Hydarnes
the Persian. Miltiades arrived with his forces and besieged the
Parians, who were driven within their walls; and sent a herald to
them to demand a hundred talents, saying, that if they did not
furnish him that sum, he would not draw off his army until he had
destroyed them. The Parians never entertained the thought of
giving Miltiades any money; but devised means by which they
might defend the city; and in several parts where the wall was
most exposed to attack, they raised it, during the night, to double
its former height. Up to this point of the story all the Greeks
agree; but after this the Parians themselves say that it happened
as follows. That when Miltiades was in a state of perplexity, a
captive woman, by birth a Parian, and named Timo, conferred with
him; she was an inferior priestess of the infernal goddesses.
When she came into the presence of Miltiades, she advised him, if
he deemed it of great consequence to take Paros, to act as she
should suggest. Following out her suggestions he came to the
mound before the city and leaped over the fence of Ceres Thesmophora,
as he was unable to open the door; and went to the
temple, for the purpose either to move some of the things that
may not be moved, or to do something or other, I know not what.
He was just at the door, when suddenly a thrill of horror came
over him, and he went back by the same way; and in leaping
over the fence his thigh was dislocated, or his knee was hurt.
Miltiades, in a bad plight, sailed back home, neither bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
money to the Athenians, nor having reduced Paros, but having
besieged it for six and twenty days, and ravaged the island.
When the Parians were informed that Timo, the priestess of the
goddesses, had directed Miltiades, they desired to punish her, and
sent deputies to the oracle at Delphi, as soon as they were relieved
from the siege, to inquire whether they should put to death the
priestess of the goddesses, for having made known to the enemy
the means of capturing the country, and for having discovered to
Miltiades sacred things, which ought not to be revealed to the
male sex. But the Pythian did not allow them, but said, "that
Timo was not to blame for this, but that it was fated Miltiades
should come to a miserable end, and she had appeared to him as a
guide to misfortune." When Miltiades returned from Paros, the
Athenians were loud in their complaints against him, especially
Xanthippus, son of Ariphron, who brought a capital charge against
Miltiades before the people, and prosecuted him for deception.
Miltiades, though present in person, made no defence, through
inability, as his thigh had begun to mortify. But while he lay on
a couch his friends made a defence for him, dwelling much on the
battle that had been fought at Marathon, and on the capture of
Lemnos; since he had taken Lemnos, and inflicted vengeance on
the Pelasgians, and had given it up to the Athenians. The people
so far favored him as to acquit him of the capital offence, but fined
him fifty talents for the injury he had done. Miltiades soon after
ended his life by the mortification of his thigh, and his son Cimon
paid the fifty talents.</p>

<h2><i>BOOK VII. POLYMNIA.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>DEATH OF DARIUS AND REIGN OF XERXES.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the news of the battle fought at Marathon reached
Darius, who was before much exasperated with the Athenians on
account of the attack upon Sardis, he grew still more eager to
prosecute the war against Greece. He therefore immediately sent
messengers to the several cities, and bade them prepare an army
much greater than they had furnished before, and ships, horses,
corn, and transports. Asia was thrown into agitation during the
space of three years, the bravest men being enrolled and prepared
for the purpose of invading Greece. In the fourth year the Egyptians,
who had been subdued by Cambyses, revolted from the Persians;
whereupon Darius only became the more eager to march
against both. Just then a violent dissension arose between the
sons of Darius concerning the sovereignty; for by the customs of
the Persians he was obliged to nominate his successor before he
marched out on any expedition. Before Darius became king, he
had three sons born to him by his former wife, the daughter of
Gobryas; and after his accession to the throne, four others by
Atossa, daughter of Cyrus. Of the former, Artabazanes was the
eldest; of those born after, Xerxes: and these two, not being of
the same mother, were at variance. Artabazanes urged that he
was the eldest of all the sons, and that it was the established usage
among all men that the eldest son should succeed to the sovereignty:
on the other hand, Xerxes alleged that he was son of Atossa,
daughter of Cyrus, and that it was Cyrus who had acquired freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
for the Persians. At this very juncture, when Darius had not
yet declared his opinion, Demaratus, son of Ariston, happened to
come up to Susa, deprived of his kingly office at Sparta, and
having imposed on himself a voluntary exile from Lacedæmon.
This man went to Xerxes, as report has it, and advised him to say
in addition to what he had already said, that "he was born after
his father Darius had become king, and was possessed of the
empire of the Persians; whereas Artabazanes was born while he
was yet a private person; wherefore it was not reasonable or just
that any other should possess that dignity in preference to himself."
"Since in Sparta also," Demaratus continued to suggest, "this custom
prevailed, that if some children were born before their father
became king, and one was born subsequently, when he had
come to the throne, this last-born son should succeed to the kingdom."
Darius acknowledged this point, and declared Xerxes king.
But it appears to me that even without this suggestion Xerxes
would have been made king, for Atossa had unbounded influence.
So Darius appointed Xerxes to be king over the Persians, and
prepared to march. But just at this juncture, and in the year after
the revolt of Egypt, Darius himself, while making preparations,
died, having reigned thirty-six years in all; nor was he able to
avenge himself either on the Egyptians, who had revolted, or on
the Athenians; and when Darius was dead, the kingdom devolved
on his son Xerxes.</p>

<p>Xerxes was at first by no means inclined to make war against
Greece, but he levied forces for the reduction of Egypt. Mardonius,
son of Gobryas, who was cousin to Xerxes, and son of Darius'
sister, and who had the greatest influence with him of all the
Persians, constantly held the following language: "Sire, it is not
right that the Athenians, who have already done so much mischief
to the Persians, should go unpunished? However, for the present,
finish the enterprise you have in hand; and when you have
quelled the insolence of Egypt, lead your army against Athens;
that you may acquire a good reputation among men, and any one
for the future may be cautious of marching against your territory."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
This language was used by him for the purpose of revenge, but he
frequently made the following addition to it, that "Europe was a
very beautiful country, and produced all kinds of cultivated trees,&mdash;and
was very fertile, and worthy to be possessed by the king alone
of all mortals." Mardonius was desirous of new enterprises, and
wished to be himself governor of Greece, and in time he persuaded
Xerxes to do as he advised. Xerxes, in the second year after the
death of Darius, reduced all Egypt to a worse state of servitude
than ever under Darius, and committed the government to
Achæmenes, his brother.</p>

<p>He then convoked an assembly of the principal Persians, that
he might hear their opinions, and make known his intentions to
them all. "Men of Persia," said Xerxes, "I learn from older men
that we have never remained inactive since we wrested the sovereign
power from the Medes, and Cyrus overthrew Astyages;
but the deity has led the way, and we have followed his guidance
to our advantage. What deeds Cyrus and Cambyses and my
father Darius have achieved, and what nations they have added to
our empire, no one need mention to you who know them well.
But since I have succeeded to the throne, I have carefully considered
how I may not fall short of my predecessors in honor, nor acquire
less additional power to the Persians."</p>

<p>"I have now called you together, that I may communicate to you
what I purpose to do. I intend to throw a bridge over the Hellespont,
and to march an army through Europe against Greece, that
I may punish the Athenians for the injuries they have done to the
Persians and to my father. You have already seen Darius preparing
to make war against those people; but he died, and had it
not in his power to avenge himself. But I, in his cause and that
of the other Persians, will not rest till I have taken and burnt
Athens; for they began by doing acts of injustice against my
father and me. First they came to Sardis, with Aristagoras the
Milesian, our servant, and burnt down the groves and the temples.
You all know well enough how they treated us on our making a
descent on their territory, when Datis and Artaphernes led our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
forces. For these reasons, therefore, I have resolved to make war
upon them. And I am sure that if we subdue them, and their
neighbors, who inhabit the country of Pelops the Phrygian, we
shall make the Persian territory co-extensive with the air of
heaven, for the sun will not look down upon any land that borders
on ours. When I shall have informed you of the time, it will be
the duty of each of you to come promptly. And whosoever shall
appear with the best-appointed troops, to him I will give such
presents as are accounted most honorable in our country."</p>

<p>After this, when Xerxes had resolved to undertake the expedition,
a vision appeared to him in his sleep, which the magi interpreted
to signify that all mankind should serve him. Xerxes imagined
that he was crowned with the sprig of an olive tree, whose
branches covered the whole earth; and that afterward the crown
that was placed on his head disappeared. After the magi had
given this interpretation, all the Persians who were assembled departed
immediately to their own governments, and used all diligence
to execute what had been ordered, every man hoping to obtain
the proposed reward; Xerxes thus levied his army, searching out
every region of the continent. He was employed four whole
years in assembling his forces and providing things necessary for
the expedition. In the fifth he began his march with a vast multitude
of men. For this was by far the greatest of all the expeditions
with which we are acquainted. What nation did not Xerxes
lead out of Asia against Greece? what stream, except that of great
rivers, did not his army drink dry? Some supplied ships;
others were ordered to furnish men for the infantry, others cavalry,
some transports for horses, together with men to serve in the
army; others had to furnish long ships for the bridges, and others
provisions and vessels.</p>

<p>And first of all, as those who had first attempted to double
Mount Athos had met with disaster, preparations were made for
nearly three years to cut Athos off by a canal. Triremes were
stationed at Eleus in the Chersonese, and from there men of every
nation from the army dug under the lash. They went in succession;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
and the people who dwelt round Athos dug also. Bubares,
son of Megabazus, and Artachæus, son of Artæus, both Persians,
presided over the work. Athos is a vast and celebrated mountain,
stretching into the sea, and inhabited by men. Where the mountain
terminates toward the continent, it is in the form of a peninsula
connected with the continent by an isthmus of about twelve
stades; this is a plain with hills of no great height from the sea of
the Acanthians to the sea which is opposite Torone. On this
isthmus stands Sana, a Grecian city; and on Athos itself are the
cities of Dion, Olophyxus, Acrothoon, Thyssus, and Cleonæ. To
make the excavation the barbarians divided the ground among the
several nations, having drawn a straight line near the city of Sana.
When the trench was deep, some stood at the bottom and continued
to dig, and others handed the soil that was dug out to men
who stood above on ladders; they again in turn handed it to
others, until they reached those that were at the top; the last
carried it off and threw it away. In the case of all, except the
Phœnicians, the brink of the excavation fell in and gave double
labor, for as they made the upper and the lower opening of equal
dimensions, this must necessarily happen. But the Phœnicians,
who show their skill in other works, did so especially in this; for
they dug the portion that fell to their share, making the upper
opening of the trench twice as large as it was necessary for
the trench itself to be; and as the work proceeded they
contracted it gradually, so that when they came to the bottom
the work was equal in width to the rest; near adjoining is a
meadow, where they had a market and bazaar, and great abundance
of meal was brought to them from Asia. According to my
deliberate opinion, Xerxes ordered this excavation to be made
from motives of ostentation, wishing to display his power, and to
leave a memorial of himself. For though it was possible, without
any great labor, to have drawn the ships over the isthmus, he
commanded them to dig a channel for the sea of such a width that
two triremes might pass through rowed abreast. And the same
persons, to whom the excavation was committed, were ordered also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
to throw a bridge over the river Strymon. He also caused
cables of papyrus and of white flax to be prepared for the bridges,
and ordered the Phœnicians and Egyptians to lay up provisions
for the army, that neither the men nor the beasts of burden might
suffer from famine on their march toward Greece, conveying them
to various quarters in merchant-ships and transports from all parts
of Asia.</p>

<p>While these men were employed in their appointed task, the
whole land-forces marched with Xerxes to Sardis, setting out from
Critalla in Cappadocia, where it had been ordered that all the
troops throughout the continent should assemble. They crossed
the river Halys, entered Phrygia, and arrived at Celænæ, where
rise the springs of the Mæander, and of another river not less than
the Mæander, which is called the Catarractes, which, springing up
in the very forum of the Celænians, discharges itself into the
Mæander; in this city the skin of Silenus Marsyas is suspended,
which, as the Phrygians report, was stripped off and suspended
by Apollo. In this city Pythius, son of Atys, a Lydian, being in
waiting, entertained the whole army of the king, and Xerxes himself,
with most sumptuous feasts; and he offered to contribute
money toward the expense of the war. Xerxes asked the Persians
near him who this Pythius was, and what riches he possessed, that
he made such an offer. They answered: "O king, this is the
person who presented your father Darius with the golden plane tree
and the vine; and he is now the richest man we know of in
the world, next to yourself." Xerxes in surprise next asked
Pythius what was the amount of his wealth. He said: "O king,
as soon as I heard you were coming down to the Grecian sea,
wishing to present you with money for the war, I made inquiry,
and found by computation that I had two thousand talents of silver,
and of gold four millions of Doric staters, lacking seven thousand.
These I freely give you; for myself I have sufficient subsistence
from my slaves and lands." Xerxes, delighted with his offer,
replied: "My Lydian friend, since I left the Persian country I
have met with no man to the present moment who was willing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
entertain my army, or who, having come into my presence, has
voluntarily offered to contribute money toward the war. But you
have entertained my army magnificently, and have offered me vast
sums; in return for this, I make you my friend. Keep what you
have acquired, and I will myself make up to you the seven thousand
staters which you lack of four millions. Be careful always to continue
such as you are, and you shall never repent hereafter."</p>

<p>From Phrygia he entered Lydia, crossed the river Mæander,
and passed by the city of Callatebus, in which confectioners make
honey with tamarisk and wheat. Xerxes, by the way, met with a
plane-tree, which, on account of its beauty, he presented with
golden ornaments, and having committed it to the care of one of
the Immortals,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
on the next day he arrived at Sardis, the capital of the Lydians.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile those who were appointed had joined
the Hellespont from Asia to Europe. There is in the Chersonese
on the Hellespont, between the city of Sestos and Madytus,
a craggy shore extending into the sea, directly opposite Abydos.
From this shore to Abydos, they had constructed two bridges, the
Phœnicians one with white flax, and the Egyptians the other with
papyrus. The distance is seven stades. When the strait was
thus united, a violent storm arose and broke in pieces and
scattered the whole work. When Xerxes heard of this, exceedingly
indignant, he commanded that the Hellespont should be
stricken with three hundred lashes with a scourge, and that a pair
of fetters should be let down into the sea. I have moreover
heard that with them he likewise sent branding instruments to
brand the Hellespont. He certainly charged those who flogged
the waters to utter these barbarous and impious words: "Thou
bitter water! thy master inflicts this punishment upon thee,
because thou hast injured him, although thou hadst not suffered
any harm from him. And king Xerxes will cross over thee,
whether thou wilt or not; it is with justice that no man sacrifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
to thee, because thou art both a deceitful and briny river!" He
accordingly commanded them to chastise the sea in this manner,
and to cut off the heads of those who had to superintend the joining
of the Hellespont. They on whom this thankless office
was imposed, carried it into execution; and other engineers constructed
bridges in the following manner. They connected
together penteconters and triremes, under the bridge toward the
Euxine sea, three hundred and sixty; and under the other,
three hundred and fourteen, obliquely to the Pontus, but in
the direction of the current of the Hellespont, that it might keep
up the tension of the cables. They then let down very long
anchors, some on the bridge toward the Pontus, on account of the
winds that blew from it within; others on the other bridge toward
the west and the Ægean, on account of the south and southeast
winds. They left an opening as a passage through between the
penteconters, in three places, that any one who wished might
be able to sail into the Pontus in light vessels, and from the
Pontus outward. Having done this, they stretched the cables from
the shore, twisting them with wooden capstans, not as before
using the two kinds separately, but assigning to each two of white
flax and four of papyrus. The thickness and quality was the
same, but those of flax were stronger in proportion, every cubit
weighing a full talent. When the passage was bridged over, they
sawed up trunks of trees, equal in length to the width of the
bridge, and laid them upon the extended cables in regular order,
fastening them securely together. They put brush-wood on
the top, and earth over the whole; and having pressed down the
earth, they drew a fence on each side, that the beasts of
burden and horses might not be frightened by looking down
upon the sea.</p>

<p>At last the works at the bridges and Mount Athos were completed,
as well as the mounds at the mouths of the canal which had
been made on account of the tide in order that the mouths of the
trench might not be choked up. News was brought that all was
ready, and the army, fresh from their winter at Sardis, set out fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
prepared at the beginning of the spring toward Abydos. But just
as they were on the point of starting, the sun quit his seat in the
heavens and disappeared, though there were no clouds, and the
air was perfectly serene, and night ensued in the place of day.
This occasioned Xerxes much uneasiness; but the magi said
"The deity foreshows to the Greeks the extinction of their cities;
the sun is the portender of the future to the Greeks, and the moon
to the Persians." Xerxes, at this, was much delighted, and set
out upon his march. As he was leading his army away, Pythius
the Lydian, terrified by the prodigy in the heavens, and emboldened
by the gifts of Xerxes, went to the king and spoke thus:
"Sire, would you indulge me by granting a boon I wish to obtain,
which is easy for you to grant, and of much importance to me."
Xerxes, expecting that he would wish for anything rather than
what he did ask, said that he would grant his request, and bade
him declare what he wanted. "Sire," said he, "I have five sons;
and it happens that they are all attending you in the expedition
against Greece. But pity me, O king, who am advanced in years,
and release one of my sons from the service, that he may take
care of me and my property. Take the other four with you, accomplish
your designs, and return home." Xerxes was highly incensed,
and answered: "Base man! hast thou dared, when I am
marching in person against Greece, and taking with me my
children, and brothers, and kinsmen, and friends to make mention
of thy son? thou who art my slave, and who wert bound in duty to
follow me with all thy family, even with thy wife. But I promise
to grant your request; I will leave your dearest son." When he
had given this answer, he immediately commanded to find out the
eldest of the sons of Pythius, and to cut his body into two halves,
and to stand one on the right of the road, and the other on the
left, while the army should pass between them.</p>

<p>This done the army passed between. The baggage-bearers
and beasts of burden first led the way; after them came a host of
all nations. When more than one half of the army had passed, an
interval was left that they might not mix with the king's troops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
Before him a thousand horsemen led the van, chosen from among
all the Persians; and next to them a thousand spearmen, these
also chosen from among all, carrying their lances turned downwards
to the earth. After these, ten immense sacred horses, gorgeously
caparisoned, called Nisæan, from the plain in the Medic territory,
which produces them; then came the sacred chariot of Jupiter,
drawn by eight white horses, followed by a charioteer on foot,
holding the reins; for no mortal ever ascends this seat. Behind
this came Xerxes himself on a chariot drawn by Nisæan horses;
and a charioteer walked at his side, whose name was Patiramphes.
In this manner Xerxes marched out of Sardis, and whenever he
thought right, he used to pass from the chariot to a covered carriage.
Behind him marched a thousand spearmen, the bravest and
noblest of the Persians, carrying their spears in the usual manner;
and after them another body of a thousand horse, chosen from
among the Persians; then ten thousand chosen Persian infantry.
Of these, one thousand had golden pomegranates on their spears
instead of ferrules, and they enclosed the others all round; the nine
thousand within had silver pomegranates. Those also that carried
their spears turned to the earth had golden pomegranates, and
those that followed nearest to Xerxes had golden apples. Behind
the ten thousand foot were placed ten thousand Persian cavalry;
and after the cavalry was left an interval of two stades; then the
rest of the throng followed promiscuously.</p>

<p>Once when the army halted during the night under Mount Ida,
thunder and lightning fell upon them, and destroyed a considerable
number of the troops on the spot. At the Scamander, the first river
on their march from Sardis, the stream failed and did not afford
sufficient drink for the army and beasts of burden. Here Xerxes
went up to the Pergamus or citadel of Priam, and sacrificed a
thousand oxen to the Ilian Minerva, and the magi poured out
libations in honor of the heroes of the Trojan War. At Abydos,
Xerxes wished to behold the whole army. And there had been
previously erected on a hill at this place, for his use, a lofty
throne of white marble; the people of Abydos had made it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
in obedience to an order of the king. Seated there, he beheld
both the land army and the fleet; he desired also to see a contest
take place between the ships, in which the Sidonian Phœnicians
were victorious. Exceedingly gratified he was, both with the
contest and the army. But while he was viewing the whole
Hellespont covered by the ships, and all the shores and the plains
of Abydos full of men, he suddenly burst into tears. Artabanus,
his paternal uncle, observed him, and exclaimed: "O king, a moment
ago you pronounced yourself happy, but now you weep."
"Alas," he answered: "Commiseration seized me, when I
considered how brief all human life is, since of these, numerous as
they are, not one will be alive in a hundred years!"</p>

<p>That day they made preparations for the passage over; and on
the following they waited for the sun, as they wished to see
it rising, in the mean time burning all sorts of perfumes on the
bridges, and strewing the road with myrtle branches. When the
sun rose, Xerxes poured a libation into the sea out of a golden
cup, and offered up a prayer to the sun, that no such accident
might befall him as would prevent him from subduing Europe, until
he had reached its utmost limits. After the prayer, he threw
the cup into the Hellespont, and a golden bowl, and a Persian
sword, which they call acinace. But I cannot determine with
certainty, whether he dropped these things into the sea as an offering
to the sun, or whether he repented of having scourged
the Hellespont, and presented these gifts to the sea as a compensation.
These ceremonies finished, the infantry and all the
cavalry crossed over by that bridge which was toward the Pontus;
and the beasts of burden and the attendants by that toward the
Ægean. I have heard that Xerxes crossed over last of all. In
seven days and seven nights without a halt his army crossed.
On this occasion it is related, that when Xerxes had crossed over
the Hellespont, a certain Hellespontine said: "O Jupiter, why,
assuming the form of a Persian, and taking the name of Xerxes,
do you wish to subvert Greece, bringing all mankind with you?
since without them it was in your power to do this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
Doriscus is a shore and extensive plain of Thrace. Through it
flows a large river, the Hebrus. A royal fort had been built,
and a Persian garrison had been established in it by Darius, from
the time that he marched against the Scythians. At Doriscus
Xerxes numbered his army. The whole land forces were found to
be seventeen hundred thousand. They were computed in this
manner: having drawn together ten thousand men in one place,
and crowded them as close together as it was possible, they
traced a circle on the outside; removed the ten thousand, threw
up a stone fence on the circle, a yard high, and made others
enter within the enclosed space, until they had in this manner
computed all.</p>

<p>The Persians were equipped as follows: On their heads
they wore loose coverings, called tiaras; on the body various-colored
sleeved breastplates, with iron scales like those of fish; and
on their legs, loose trousers; instead of shields they had bucklers
made of osiers; and under them their quivers were hung. They
had short spears, long bows, and arrows made of cane, besides
daggers suspended from the girdle on the right thigh. They had
for their general, Otanes, father of Amestris, wife of Xerxes.
They were formerly called Cephenes by the Grecians, but by
themselves and neighbors, Artæans. But when Perseus, son of
Danae and Jupiter, came to Cepheus, son of Belus, and married
his daughter Andromeda, he had a son to whom he gave the name
of Perses; and from him they derived their appellation. The
Medes marched equipped in the same manner as the Persians;
for the above is a Medic and not a Persian costume. The Medes
had for their general, Tigranes, of the family of the Achæmenidæ:
they were formerly called Arians by all nations; but when Medea
of Colchis came from Athens to these Arians, they also changed
their names. The Assyrians who served in the army had helmets
of bronze, twisted in a barbarous fashion, not easy to describe; and
shields and spears, with daggers similar to those of the Egyptians,
besides wooden clubs knotted with iron, and linen cuirasses. By
the Greeks they were called Syrians, but by the barbarians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
Assyrians. Among them were the Chaldeans; and Otaspes, son
of Artachæus commanded them. The Bactrians had turbans
on their heads, very much like those of the Medes, and bows made
of cane peculiar to their country, and short spears. The Sacæ,
who are Scythians, had on their heads caps, which came to a
point and stood erect: they also wore loose trousers, and carried
bows peculiar to their country, and daggers, and also battle-axes,
called sagares. The Indians, clad with garments made of cotton,
had bows of cane, and arrows of cane tipped with iron.</p>

<p>The Arabians wore cloaks fastened by a girdle; and carried on
their right sides long bows which bent backward. The Ethiopians
were clothed in panthers' and lions' skins, and carried long bows,
not less than four cubits in length, made from branches of the
palm-tree; and on them they placed short arrows made of cane,
instead of iron, tipped with a stone, which was made sharp, and of
the sort on which they engrave seals. Besides, they had javelins,
and at the tip was an antelope's horn, made sharp, like a lance;
they had also knotted clubs. When they were going to battle,
they smeared one half of their body with chalk, and the other half
with red ochre. The Arabians and Ethiopians who dwell above
Egypt were commanded by Arsames, son of Darius and Artystone,
daughter of Cyrus, whom Darius loved more than all his wives,
and whose image he had made of beaten gold. The Ethiopians
from the sun-rise (for two kinds served in the expedition) were
marshalled with the Indians, and did not at all differ from the others
in appearance, except in their language and their hair. For the
eastern Ethiopians are straight-haired; but those of Libya have
hair more curly than that of any other people. These Ethiopians
from Asia were accoutred almost the same as the Indians; but
they wore on their heads skins of horses' heads, as masks, stripped
off with the ears and mane; and the mane served instead of a
crest, and the horses' ears were fixed erect; and as defensive
armor they used the skins of cranes instead of shields. The Libyans
marched, clad in leathern garments, and made use of javelins
hardened by fire. They had for their general, Massages, son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
Oarizus. The Paphlagonians joined the expedition, wearing on
their heads plated helmets, and carried small shields, and not large
spears, besides javelins and daggers: and on their feet they wore
boots, peculiar to their country, reaching up to the middle of the
leg. The Thracians wore fox-skins on their heads, and tunics
around their bodies, and over them they were clothed with various-colored
cloaks, and on their feet and legs they had buskins of fawn-skin,
and carried javelins, light bucklers, and small daggers. These
people having crossed over into Asia, were called Bithynians; but
formerly, as they themselves say, were called Strymonians, as they
dwelt on the river Strymon.</p>

<p>These, with very many others, were the nations that marched
on the continent and composed the infantry. Over these and the
whole infantry was appointed as general, Mardonius, son of Gobryas.
But of the ten thousand chosen Persians, Hydarnes was
general. These Persians were called Immortal, for the following
reason: If any one of them made a deficiency in the number, compelled
either by death or disease, another was ready chosen to
supply his place; so that they were never either more or less than
ten thousand. The Persians displayed the greatest splendor of
all, and were also the bravest; their equipment was such as has
been described; but besides this, they were conspicuous from
having a great profusion of gold. They also brought with them
covered chariots and a numerous and well-equipped train of attendants.
Camels and other beasts of burden conveyed their provisions,
apart from that of the rest of the soldiers.</p>

<p>All these nations have cavalry; they did not, however, all furnish
horse, but only the following. First, the Persians, equipped
in the same manner as their infantry, except that on their heads
some of them wore bronze and wrought-steel ornaments. There
is a certain nomadic race, called Sagartians, of Persian extraction
and language, who wear a dress fashioned between the Persian
and the Pactyan fashion; they furnished eight thousand horse, but
they are not accustomed to carry arms either of bronze or iron, except
daggers: they use lassos made of twisted thongs. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
mode of fighting of these men is as follows: When they engage
with the enemy they throw out the ropes, which have nooses at
the end, and whatever any one catches, whether horse or man, he
drags toward himself; and they that are entangled in the coils are
put to death. The Arabians had the same dress as their infantry,
but all rode camels not inferior to horses in speed. The number
of the horse amounted to eighty thousand, besides the camels and
chariots. All the rest of the cavalry were marshalled in troops;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
but the Arabians were stationed in the rear, as horses cannot endure
camels. Armamithres and Tithæus, sons of Datis, were generals
of the cavalry. Their third colleague in command, Pharnuches,
had been left at Sardis sick. For as they were setting out from
Sardis he met with a sad accident. When he was mounted, a dog
ran under the legs of his horse, and the horse, frightened, reared
and threw Pharnuches, who vomited blood, and the disease turned
to a consumption. With respect to the horse, his servants immediately
led him to the place where he had thrown his master, and
cut off his legs at the knees.</p>

<p>The number of the triremes amounted to twelve hundred and
seven.</p>

<p>Persians, Medes, and Sacæ served as marines on board all the
ships. Of these the Phœnicians furnished the best sailing ships,
and of the Phœnicians the Sidonians. The admirals of the navy
were: Ariabignes, son of Darius; Prexaspes, son of Aspathines;
Megabazus son of Megabates; and Achæmenes, son of Darius.
Of the other captains I make no mention, as I deem it unnecessary,
except of Artemisia, whom I most admire, as having, though
a woman, joined this expedition against Greece. Her husband
was dead, but, holding the sovereignty while her son was under
age, she joined the expedition from a feeling of courage and
manly spirit, though there was no necessity for her doing so. Her
name was Artemisia, and she was the daughter of Lygdamis, by
birth of Halicarnassus on her father's side, and on her mother's a
Cretan. She commanded the Halicarnassians, the Coans, the
Nisyrians, and the Calyndians, having contributed five ships: and
of the whole fleet, next to the Sidonians, she furnished the most
renowned ships, and of all the allies, gave the best advice to the
king. The cities which I have mentioned as being under her
command, I pronounce to be all of Doric origin; the Halicarnassians
being Trœzenians, and the rest Epidaurians.</p>

<p>When Xerxes had numbered his forces, and the army was
drawn up he desired to pass through and inspect them in person.
Accordingly he drove through in a chariot, by each separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
nation, made inquiries, and his secretaries wrote down the
answers; until he had gone from one extremity to the other, both
of the horse and foot. When he had finished this, and the ships
had been launched into the sea, Xerxes, in a Sidonian ship, under
a gilded canopy, sailed by the prows of the ships, asking questions
of each, as he had done with the land-forces, and having the
answers written down.</p>

<p>When Xerxes arrived at Therma, he ordered his army to halt.
And seeing from Therma the Thessalonian mountains, Olympus
and Ossa, which are of vast size, and having learnt that there was a
narrow pass between them, through which the river Peneus runs, and
hearing that at that spot there was a road leading to Thessaly, very
much wished to sail and see the mouth of the Peneus. When
Xerxes arrived, and beheld its mouth, he was struck with great
astonishment. For several rivers, five of them greatly noted, the
Peneus, the Apidanus, the Onochonus, the Enipeus, and the Pamisus,
meeting together in this plain from the mountains that enclose
Thessaly, discharge themselves into the sea through one channel,
and that a narrow one; but as soon as they have mingled together,
from that spot the names of the other rivers merge in that of the
Peneus.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>
The Thessalians say, that Neptune made the pass
through which the Peneus flows; and their story is probable. For
whoever thinks that Neptune shakes the earth, and that rents occasioned
by earthquakes are the works of this god, on seeing this,
would say that Neptune formed it. For it appears evident to me,
that the separation of these mountains is the effect of an earthquake.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>BATTLE OF THERMOPYLÆ.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Greeks arrived at the Isthmus they consulted in
what way and in what places they should prosecute the war. The
opinion which prevailed was that they should defend the pass at
Thermopylæ; for it appeared to be narrower than that into Thessaly,
and at the same time nearer to their own territories. On
the western side of Thermopylæ is an inaccessible and precipitous
mountain, stretching to Mount Œta; and on the eastern side of
the way is the sea and a morass. In this passage there are hot
baths, which the inhabitants call Chytri, and above these is an altar
to Hercules. A wall had been built in this pass, and formerly
there were gates in it. The Phocians built it through fear, when
the Thessalians came from Thesprotia to settle in the Æolian territory
which they now possess, apprehending that the Thessalians
would attempt to subdue them; at the same time they diverted
the hot water into the entrance, that the place might be broken
into clefts; having recourse to every contrivance to prevent the
Thessalians from making inroads into their country. Now this
old wall had been built a long time, and the greater part of it had
already fallen through age; but they determined to rebuild it, and
in that place to repel the barbarian from Greece. Very near this
road there is a village called Alpeni, from which they expected to
obtain provisions.</p>

    <p>CYCLOPEAN WALLS AT CEPHALLOMA.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The naval forces of Xerxes, setting out from the city of Therma,
advanced with ten of the fastest sailing ships straight to Scyathus,
where were three Greek ships keeping a look-out, a Trœzenian
an Æginetan, and an Athenian. These, seeing the ships of
the barbarians at a distance, betook themselves to flight. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
Trœzenian ship, which Praxinus commanded, the barbarians pursued
and soon captured; and then, having led the handsomest of
the marines to the prow of the ship, they slew him, deeming it a
good omen that the first Greek they had taken was also very
handsome. The name of the man that was slain was Leon, and
perhaps he in some measure reaped the fruits of his name. The
Æginetan ship, which Asonides commanded, gave them some
trouble, Pytheas, son of Ischenous, being a marine on board, a
man who on this day displayed the most consummate valor; who,
when the ship was taken, continued fighting until he was almost
cut to pieces. But when they found that he was not dead, but
still breathed, the Persians who served on board the ships were
very anxious to save him alive, on account of his valor, healing
his wounds with myrrh, and binding them with bandages of flaxen
cloth. And when they returned to their own camp, they showed
him with admiration to the whole army, and treated him well; but
the others, whom they took in this ship, they treated as slaves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
Thus, two of the ships were taken; but the third, which Phormus,
an Athenian, commanded, in its flight ran ashore at the mouth of
the Peneus; and the barbarians got possession of the ship, but not
of the men: for as soon as the Athenians had run the ship
aground, they leaped out, and, proceeding through Thessaly,
reached Athens. The Greeks who were stationed at Artemisium
were informed of this event by signal-fires from Scyathus.</p>

<p>As far as Thermopylæ, the army of Xerxes had suffered no loss,
and the numbers were at that time, as I find by calculation of those
in ships from Asia, a total of five hundred and seventeen thousand
six hundred and ten. Of infantry there were seventeen hundred
thousand, and of cavalry eighty thousand; to these I add the
Arabians who rode camels, and the Libyans who drove chariots,
reckoning the number of twenty thousand men. Accordingly, the
numbers on board the ships and on the land added together, make
up two millions three hundred and seventeen thousand six hundred
and ten, exclusive of the servants that followed, and the provision
ships, and the men that were on board them. But the force brought
from Europe must still be added to this whole number, of which I
suppose that there were three hundred thousand men. So that
these myriads added to those from Asia, make a total of two millions
six hundred and forty one thousand six hundred and ten fighting
men. I think that the servants who followed them, together with
those on board the provision ships and other vessels that sailed
with the fleet, were not fewer than the fighting men, probably more
numerous; but supposing them to be equal in number with the
fighting men, Xerxes, son of Darius, led five millions two hundred
and eighty-three thousand two hundred and twenty men to Thermopylæ.
This, then, was the number of the whole force of Xerxes.
But the number of women who made bread, wives of officers, and
servants, no one could mention with accuracy; nor of draught-cattle
and other beasts of burden; nor of Indian dogs that followed.
I am not astonished that the streams of some rivers failed; rather
is it a wonder to me how the provisions held out for so many myriads.
For I find by calculation, if each man had a chœnix of wheat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
daily, and no more, one hundred and ten thousand three hundred
and forty medimni must have been consumed every day; and I
have not reckoned the food for the women, beasts of burden, and
dogs. But, of so many myriads of men, not one of them, for beauty
and stature, was more entitled than Xerxes himself to possess this
power.</p>

    <p>ISLAND AND CASTLE OF CORFU.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Greeks who awaited the Persian at Thermopylæ were: of
Spartans three hundred heavy-armed men; of Tegeans and Mantineans
one thousand, half of each; from Orchomenus in Arcadia
one hundred and twenty; and from the rest of Arcadia one thousand;
from Corinth four hundred; from Phlius two hundred men,
and from Mycenæ eighty. These came from Peloponnesus. From
Bœotia, of Thespians seven hundred, and of Thebans four hundred.
In addition to these, the Opuntian Locrians, being invited,
came with all their forces, and a thousand Phocians. These nations
had separate generals for their several cities; but the one
most admired, and who commanded the whole army, was a Lacedæmonian,
Leonidas, son of Anaxandrides, and a descendant of
Hercules, who had unexpectedly succeeded to the throne of Sparta.
For as he had two elder brothers, Cleomenes and Dorieus, he was
far from any thought of the kingdom. However, Cleomenes and
Dorieus both died, and the kingdom thus devolved upon Leonidas.
He had chosen the three hundred men allowed by law, and
marched to Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>When the Persian came near the pass, the Greeks, alarmed,
consulted about a retreat, and it seemed best to the other Peloponnesians
to retire to Peloponnesus, and guard the Isthmus; but
Leonidas, perceiving the Phocians and Locrians very indignant at
this proposition, determined to stay there, and to despatch messengers
to the cities, desiring them to come to their assistance, as
being too few to repel the army of the Medes. Meantime Xerxes
sent a scout on horseback, to see how many they were, and what
they were doing. For while he was still in Thessaly, he had heard
that a small army had been assembled at that spot, whose leader
was Leonidas, of the race of Hercules. When the horseman rode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
up to the camp, he reconnoitred, and saw not indeed the whole
camp, for it was not possible that they should be seen who were
posted within the wall, but he had a clear view of those on the
outside, whose arms were piled in front of the wall. At this some
of the Lacedæmonians were performing gymnastic exercises, and
others combing their hair. On beholding this he was astonished,
but having ascertained their number, he rode back at his leisure,
for no one pursued him, and he met with general contempt. On
his return he gave an account to Xerxes of all that he had seen,
who could not comprehend the truth, that the Greeks were preparing
to be slain and to slay to the utmost of their power.</p>

<p>Xerxes let five days pass, constantly expecting that they would
betake themselves to flight. But on the fifth day, as they had not
retreated, but appeared to him to stay through arrogance and
rashness, in rage he sent the Medes and Cissians against them,
with orders to take them alive, and bring them into his presence.
When the Medes bore down impetuously upon the Greeks, many
of them fell; others followed to the charge, and were not repulsed,
though they suffered greatly. But they made it evident to every
one, and not least of all to the king himself, that they were indeed
many men, but few soldiers. The engagement lasted through the
day. The Medes, roughly handled, retired; and the Persians
whom the king called "Immortal," and whom Hydarnes commanded,
took their place and advanced to the attack, thinking
that they indeed should easily settle the business. But they succeeded
no better than the Medic troops, but just the same, as they
fought in a narrow space, and used shorter spears than the
Greeks, and were unable to avail themselves of their numbers.
The Lacedæmonians fought memorably, showing that they knew
how to fight with men who knew not, and whenever they turned
their backs, they retreated in close order; but the barbarians
seeing them retreat, followed with a shout and clamor; then they,
being overtaken, wheeled round so as to front the barbarians and
overthrew an inconceivable number of the Persians; and then
some few of the Spartans themselves fell. So that when the Persians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
were unable to gain any thing in their attempt on the pass,
by attacking in troops and in every possible manner, they retired.
It is said that during these onsets of the battle, the king, who witnessed
them, thrice sprang from his throne, being alarmed for his
army. On the following day the barbarians fought with no better
success; for considering that the Greeks were few in number, and
expecting that they were covered with wounds, and would not be
able to raise their heads against them any more, they renewed the
contest. But the Greeks were marshalled in companies and
according to their several nations, and each fought in turn, except
the Phocians, who were stationed at the mountain to guard the
pathway. Again the Persians failed and retired.</p>

<p>While the king was in doubt what course to take, Ephialtes,
son of Eurydemus, a Malian, obtained an audience of him, expecting
that he should receive a great reward from the king, and
informed him of the path which leads over the mountain to Thermopylæ;
and by that means caused the destruction of those
Greeks who were stationed there. Afterwards, fearing the Lacedæmonians,
he fled to Thessaly, and a price was set on his head
by the Pylagori, when the Amphictyons were assembled at Pylæ.
But some time after, he went down to Anticyra, and was killed by
Athenades, a Trachinian. This Athenades killed him for another
reason, which I shall mention in a subsequent part of my history;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>
he was however rewarded none the less by the Lacedæmonians.
Xerxes, exceedingly delighted with what Ephialtes promised to
perform, immediately despatched Hydarnes with his troops from
the camp about the hour of lamp-lighting.</p>

<p>All night long the Persians marched, and at dawn reached the
summit of the mountain. Here, as I have already mentioned, a
thousand heavy-armed Phocians kept guard, to defend their own
country, and to secure the pathway. The whole mountain was
covered with oaks; there was a perfect calm, and as a considerable
rustling took place from the leaves strewn under foot, the
Phocians sprang up and put on their arms, just as the barbarians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
made their appearance. Hit by many thick-falling arrows, the
Phocians fled to the summit of the mountain, prepared to perish.
But the Persians took no further notice of the Phocians, but
marched down the mountain with all speed.</p>

<p>To the Greeks at Thermopylæ, the augur Megistias, having
inspected the sacrifices, first made known the death that would
befall them in the morning; certain deserters afterwards came and
brought intelligence of the circuit the Persians were taking while
it was yet night; and, thirdly, the scouts running down from the
heights, as soon as day dawned, brought the same intelligence.
It had been announced to the Spartans, by the oracle of Apollo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
when they went to consult concerning this war, "that either
Lacedæmon must be overthrown by the barbarians, or their king
perish." This answer the prophetess gave in hexameter verses to
this effect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote">"Hear me, ye men of spacious Lacedæmon!</div>
<div class="verse">Either your glorious town must be destroyed,</div>
<div class="verse">By the fell hand of warriors sprung from Perseus,</div>
<div class="verse">Or else the confines of fair Lacedæmon</div>
<div class="verse">Must mourn a king of Heracleidan race,</div>
<div class="verse">For all the strength of lions or of bulls</div>
<div class="verse">Is nought to him who has the strength of Zeus;</div>
<div class="verse">And never shall that monarch be restrained</div>
<div class="verse">Until he takes your city or your king."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Xerxes poured out libations at sun-rise, waited a short time,
and began his attack about the time of full market, as he had
been instructed by Ephialtes. The Greeks with Leonidas, marching
out as if for certain death, now advanced much farther than
before into the wide part of the defile. For the fortification of the
wall had protected them, on the preceding day, in the narrow part.
But now engaging outside the narrows, great numbers of the
barbarians fell. The officers of the companies from behind, with
scourges, flogged every man, constantly urging them forward, so
that many of them falling into the sea, perished, and many more
were trampled alive under foot by one another; and no regard
was paid to any that perished. The Greeks, knowing that death
awaited them at the hands of those who were going round
the mountain, were desperate, and regardless of their own lives,
displayed the utmost possible valor against the barbarians. Already
were most of their javelins broken, and they had begun to
despatch the Persians with their swords. In this part of the struggle
fell Leonidas, fighting valiantly, and with him other eminent
Spartans, whose names, seeing they were deserving men, I have
ascertained; indeed I have ascertained the names of the whole
three hundred. On the side of the Persians, also, many other
eminent men fell on this occasion, amongst them two sons of
Darius, Abrocomes and Hyperanthes, fighting for the body of
Leonidas; and there was a violent struggle between the Persians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
and Lacedæmonians, until at last the Greeks rescued it by their
valor, and four times repulsed the enemy. Thus the contest continued
until the Greeks heard that those with Ephialtes were
approaching. Then they retreated to the narrow part of the way,
and, passing beyond the wall, came and took up their position on
the rising ground, all in a compact body, with the exception of the
Thebans: the rising ground is at the entrance where the stone
lion now stands to the memory of Leonidas. On this spot they
defended themselves, first with their swords, then with their hands
and teeth, until the barbarians overwhelmed them with missiles in
front, and from above, and on every side.</p>

<p>Dieneces, a Spartan, is said to have been the bravest man.
They relate that before the engagement with the Medes, having
heard a Trachinian say, that when the barbarians let fly their
arrows, they would obscure the sun by the multitude of their
shafts, so great were their numbers, he replied, not at all alarmed:
"That's good; we shall have the pleasure, then, of fighting in
the shade." In honor of the slain, who were buried on the spot
where they fell, and of those who died before, these inscriptions
have been engraved upon stones above them; the first:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote">"From Peloponnesus came four thousand men;</div>
<div class="verse">And on this spot fought with three hundred myriads."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The second was in honor of the three hundred Spartans:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>An engraved monument was also erected to Megistias the
augur, by his friend Simonides, and was as follows:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse quote">"The monument of famed Megistias,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Slain by the Medes what time they passed the Sperchius;</div>
<div class="verse">A seer, who though he knew impending fate,</div>
<div class="verse">Would not desert the gallant chiefs of Sparta."</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Two of these three hundred, Eurytus and Aristodemus, had
been dismissed from the camp by Leonidas, and were lying
at Alpeni desperately afflicted with a disease of the eyes. But
when Eurytus heard of the circuit made by the Persians, he called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
for his arms and ordered his helot to lead him to the combatants;
and, while the slave in terror ran away, his brave half-blind master
rushed into the midst of the throng and perished; but Aristodemus,
failing in courage, was left behind. Now if it had happened that
Aristodemus had returned sick to Sparta, or if both had gone home
together, in my opinion the Spartans would not have shown
any anger against them. But since one of them perished, and
the other, who had only the same excuse, refused to die, they must
needs get exceedingly angry with Aristodemus. On his return to
Lacedæmon he was met with insults and infamy. Not one of the
Spartans would either give him fire or converse with him: and he
was jeered and hooted at by the boys who called him "Aristodemus
the coward." However, in the battle of Platæa he removed all the
disgrace that attached to him, for he earned the title of the bravest
of the Spartans, and recklessly lost his life. Xerxes after the
massacre passed through among the dead; and having heard that
Leonidas was king and general of the Lacedæmonians, he commanded
them to cut off his head, and fix it upon a pole. It is clear
to me from many other proofs, and not least of all from this,
that king Xerxes was more highly incensed against Leonidas
during his life, than against any other man; for otherwise he
would never have violated the respect due to his dead body;

are wont to honor men who are brave in war.</p>

<h2><i>BOOK VIII. URANIA.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE INVASION OF ATTICA AND THE BATTLE OF SALAMIS.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Greek fleet from Artemisium put in at Salamis at the request
of the Athenians, who wished to remove their children and
wives out of Attica, and consult what measures were to be taken.
The Athenians caused proclamation to be made, "that every one
should save his children and family by the best means he could."
Thereupon the greatest part sent away their families to Trœzen,
some to Ægina, and others to Salamis. They used all diligence to
remove them to a place of safety, from a desire to obey the oracle,
but more particularly for the following reason. The Athenians say
that a large serpent used to live in the temple as a guard to the
Acropolis; they used to do it honor by placing before it its
monthly food, consisting of a honey-cake: this honey-cake in
former time had always been consumed, but now it remained untouched.
When the priestess made this known, the Athenians,
with more readiness, abandoned the city, since even the goddess
had forsaken the Acropolis. As soon as every thing had been deposited
in a place of safety, they sailed to the encampment. Many
more ships were assembled together than had fought at Artemisium,
and from a greater number of cities. The same admiral
commanded them as at Artemisium, Eurybiades, son of Euryclides,
a Spartan, though he was not of the royal family. The
Athenians, however, furnished by far the most and the best sailing
ships. The whole number of ships besides the penteconters,
amounted to three hundred and seventy-eight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
When the leaders from the various cities met together at Salamis,
they held a council, in which Eurybiades proposed that any
one who chose should deliver his opinion, where he thought it
would be most advantageous to come to an engagement by sea,
of all the places of which they were still in possession: for Attica
was already given up. Most of the opinions of those who spoke
coincided, that they should sail to the Isthmus, and fight before
Peloponnesus; alleging this reason, that if they should be conquered
by sea while they were at Salamis, they would be besieged
in the island, where no succor could reach them; but if at the
Isthmus, they might escape to their own cities.</p>

    <p>ANCIENT GREEK WALLS RESTORED.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>While the commanders from Peloponnesus were debating these
matters, an Athenian arrived with intelligence, that the barbarian
had entered Attica, and was devastating the whole of it by fire.
The army with Xerxes were thus three months en route from the
passage over the Hellespont, till they arrived at Athens. They
took the city, deserted of inhabitants, but found a few of the Athenians
in the temple, with the treasurers of the temple and some
poor people; who, having fortified the Acropolis with planks
and stakes, tried to keep off the invaders: they had not
withdrawn to Salamis, partly through want of means, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
moreover they thought they had found out the meaning
of the oracle which the Pythian delivered to them, that the
wooden wall "should be impregnable"; imagining, that this
was the refuge according to the oracle, and not the ships. The
Persians, posting themselves on the hill opposite the Acropolis,
which the Athenians call the Areopagus, wrapped tow round their
arrows, and setting fire to it, shot them at the fence. But those
Athenians who were besieged, still defended themselves, though
driven to the last extremity, and the fence had failed them; nor,
when the Pisistratidæ proposed them, would they listen to terms of
capitulation; but still defending themselves, they contrived other
means of defence, and when the barbarians approached the gates,
they hurled down large round stones; so that Xerxes was for a
long time kept in perplexity, not being able to capture them. At
length, in the midst of these difficulties, an entrance was discovered
by the barbarians; for it was necessary, according to the oracle,
that all Attica, on the continent, should be subdued by the Persians.
In front of the Acropolis, but behind the gates and where
no one kept guard, nor would ever have expected that any man
would ascend, there some of them ascended near the temple of
Cecrops' daughter Aglauros. When the Athenians saw that the
enemy were in the Acropolis, some threw themselves down from
the wall and perished, and others took refuge in the recess of the
temple. But the Persians who had ascended first turned to the
gates, opened them, and put the suppliants to death: and when all
were thrown prostrate, they pillaged the temple and set fire to the
whole Acropolis.</p>

<p>The Greeks at Salamis, when intelligence was brought them
how matters stood in Athens, were thrown into such consternation,
that some of the generals would not wait until the subject before
them was decided on, but rushed to their ships and hoisted sail, as
about to hurry away; by such of them as remained it was determined
to come to an engagement before the Isthmus. Night came
on, and they, being dismissed from the council, went on board their
ships. Thereupon Mnesiphilus, an Athenian, inquired of Themistocles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
on his return to his ship, what had been determined on by
them. And being informed by him that it was resolved to conduct
the ships to the Isthmus, and to come to an engagement before the
Peloponnesus, he said, "If they remove the ships from Salamis,
you will no longer fight for any country; for they will each betake
themselves to their cities; and neither will Eurybiades nor any one
else be able to detain them, so that the fleet should not be dispersed;
and Greece will perish through want of counsel. But, if
there is any possible contrivance, go and endeavor to annul the decree,
if by any means you can induce Eurybiades to alter his
determination, so as to remain here." The suggestion pleased
Themistocles exceedingly; and without answer he went to the ship
of Eurybiades, and said that he wished to confer with him on public
business. He desired him to come on board his ship, and say
what he wished. Thereupon Themistocles, seating himself by him,
repeated all that he had heard from Mnesiphilus, making it his own,
and adding much more, until he prevailed on him, by entreaty, to
leave his ship, and assemble the commanders in council. The upshot
of the matter was that Themistocles persuaded the generals in
council to remain and fight at Salamis. Day came, and at sunrise
an earthquake took place on land and at sea. They determined to
pray to the gods, and to invoke the Æacidæ as allies. For having
prayed to all the gods, they forthwith, from Salamis, invoked
Ajax and Telamon; and sent a ship to Ægina for Æacus, and the
Æacidae. In the mean time, all the admirals and captains of
Xerxes' fleet advised engaging in a sea-fight, except Artemisia,
who spoke as follows: "Tell the king from me, Mardonius, that I
say this. It is right that I, sire, who proved myself by no means
a coward in the sea-fight off Eubœa, and performed achievements
not inferior to others, should declare my real opinion, and state
what I think best for your interest. Therefore I say this, abstain
from using your ships, nor risk a sea-fight; for these men are as
much superior to your men by sea, as men are to women. And
why must you run a risk by a naval engagement? Have you not
possession of Athens, for the sake of which you undertook this expedition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
and have you not the rest of Greece? They will not be
able to hold out long against you; but will soon disperse, and fly
to their cities."</p>

<p>Xerxes was very much pleased with the opinion of Artemisia;
he had before thought her an admirable woman, but now he
praised her much more. However, he gave orders to follow the
advice of the majority in this matter, thinking that they had behaved
ill at Eubœa on purpose, because he was not present. He
now prepared in person to behold them engaging by sea.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, those at Salamis were growing alarmed, and wondered
at the imprudence of Eurybiades; till at last their discontent
broke out openly, and a council was called, and much was said
on the subject. Some said that they ought to sail for the
Peloponnesus, and hazard a battle for that, and not stay and fight
for a place already taken by the enemy; but the Athenians,
Æginetæ, and Megareans, declared that they should stay there
and defend themselves. Thereupon, Themistocles, when he saw
his opinion was overruled by the Peloponnesians, went secretly
out of the council, and despatched a man in a boat to the encampment
of the Medes instructing him what to say: his name was
Sicinnus, and he was a domestic, and preceptor to the children of
Themistocles. After these events, Themistocles got him made a
Thespian, when the Thespians augmented the number of their
citizens, and gave him a competent fortune. He, arriving in the
boat, spoke as follows to the generals of the barbarians: "The
general of the Athenians has sent me, unknown to the rest of the
Greeks, (for he is in the interest of the king, and wishes that your
affairs may prosper, rather than those of the Greeks,) to inform
you that the Greeks, in great consternation, are deliberating on
flight; and you have now an opportunity of achieving the most
glorious of all enterprises, if you do not suffer them to escape.
For they do not agree among themselves, nor will they oppose
you; but you will see those who are in your interest, and those
who are not, fighting with one another." Having delivered this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
message to them, he immediately departed. As these tidings appeared
to them worthy of credit, they immediately landed a considerable
number of Persians on the little island of Psyttalea, lying
between Salamis and the continent; and, when it was midnight,
they got their western wing under way, drawing it in a circle
toward Salamis, and those who were stationed about Ceos and
Cynosura got under way and occupied the whole passage as far
as Munychia with their ships, so that the Greeks might have no
way to escape, but, being shut up in Salamis, might suffer punishment
for the conflicts at Artemisium; and they landed the Persians
at the little island of Psyttalea for this reason: that, when an
engagement should take place, as they expected the greater part
of the men and wrecks would be driven there, they might save
the one and destroy the other. These things they did in silence,
that the enemy might not know what was going on.</p>

<p>I am unable to speak against the truth of oracles, when I think
of the remarkable oracle of Bacis: "When they shall bridge with
ships the sacred shore of "Diana with the golden sword," and sea-girt
Cynosura, having with mad hope destroyed beautiful Athens,
then divine Vengeance shall quench strong Presumption, son of
Insolence, when thinking to subvert all things. For bronze shall
engage with bronze, and Mars shall redden the sea with blood.
Then the far-thundering son of Saturn and benign victory shall
bring a day of freedom to Greece." After such a prediction and
its fulfilment, I neither dare myself say any thing in contradiction
to oracles, nor allow others to do so.</p>

<p>All this night there was a great altercation between the generals
at Salamis. They did not yet know that the barbarians had
surrounded them with their ships. They supposed that they were
in the same place where they had seen them stationed during the
day. While the generals were disputing, Aristides, son of Lysimachus,
crossed over from the Ægina. He was an Athenian, but
had been banished by ostracism. From what I have heard of his
manner of life, I consider him to have been the best and most upright
man in Athens. He, standing at the entrance of the council,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
called Themistocles out, who was not indeed his friend, but his
most bitter enemy; yet from the greatness of the impending
danger, he forgot that, and called him, for he had already heard
that those from Peloponnesus were anxious to get the ships under
way for the Isthmus. When Themistocles came out, Aristides
spoke as follows: "It is right that we should strive, both on other
occasions, and particularly on this, which of us shall do the greatest
service to our country. I assure you, that to say little or much to
the Peloponnesians about sailing from here is a waste of breath;
for I, an eye-witness, tell you, now, even if they would, neither
the Corinthians, nor Eurybiades himself, will be able to sail away;
for we are on all sides enclosed by the enemy. Go in, and acquaint
them with this." But Themistocles bade Aristides go in
himself and convey the tidings. This he did, but the generals
would not even then give credence to his report until there arrived
a trireme of Tenians that had deserted, which Panætius, son of
Socimenes, commanded, and which brought an account of the
whole truth. For that action the name of the Tenians was engraved
on the tripod at Delphi, among those who had defeated
the barbarian. With this ship that came over at Salamis, and
with the Lemnian before, off Artemisium, the Grecian fleet was
made up to the full number of three hundred and eighty ships; for
before it wanted two of that number.</p>

<p>Day dawned, and when they had mustered the marines,
Themistocles, above all the others, harangued them most eloquently.
His speech was entirely taken up in contrasting better things with
worse, exhorting them to choose the best of all those things which
depended on the nature and condition of man. As soon as the
trireme from Ægina, which had gone to fetch the Æacidæ returned
the Greeks got all their ships under way. The barbarians
immediately fell upon them. Now all the other Greeks began to
back water and make for the shore; but Aminias of Pallene, an
Athenian, being carried onward, attacked a ship; and his ship becoming
entangled with the other, and the crew not being able to
clear, the rest thereupon came to the assistance of Aminias and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
engaged. Thus the Athenians say the battle commenced; but
the Æginetæ affirm that the ship which went to Ægina to
fetch the Æacidæ, was the first to begin. It is also said, that a
phantom of a woman appeared to them, that she cheered them on,
so that the whole fleet of Greeks heard her, after she had first
reproached them in these words: "Dastards, how long will you
back water?" Opposite the Athenians the Phœnicians were
drawn up, for they occupied the wing toward Eleusis and westward;
opposite the Lacedæmonians, the Ionians occupied the wing toward
the east and the Piræus. Of these some few behaved ill on
purpose, in compliance with the injunctions of Themistocles. The
greater part of the ships were run down at Salamis; some being
destroyed by the Athenians, others by the Æginetæ. For the
Greeks fought in good order, in line, but the barbarians were
neither properly formed nor did any thing with judgment. However
they proved themselves to be far braver on this day than off
Eubœa, every one exerting himself vigorously, and dreading
Xerxes; for each thought that he himself was observed by the
king.</p>

<p>I am unable to say with certainty how each of the barbarians
or Greeks fought; but with respect to Artemisia, the following incident
occurred, by which she obtained still greater credit with the
king. For when the king's forces were in great confusion, the
ship of Artemisia was chased by an Attic ship, and not being able
to escape, she resolved upon a stratagem. For being pursued by
the Athenian, she bore down upon a friendly ship, manned by
Calyndians, and with Damasithymus himself, king of the Calyndians,
on board; whether she had any quarrel with him while they
were at the Hellespont, I am unable to say, or whether she did it
on purpose, or whether the ship of the Calyndians happened by
chance to be in her way; however, she ran it down, and sunk it,
and by good fortune gained a double advantage to herself. For
when the captain of the Attic ship saw her bearing down on a
ship of the barbarians, he concluded Artemisia's ship to be either
a Greek or one that had deserted from the enemy and was assisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
them, and so turned aside and attacked others. Thus she
escaped, and in consequence of it became still more in favor with
Xerxes. For it is said that Xerxes, looking on, observed her
ship making the attack, and that some near him said: "Sire, do
you see how well Artemisia fights; she has sunk one of the
enemy's ships?" Whereupon he asked if it was in truth the exploit
of Artemisia; they answered "that they knew the ensign of
her ship perfectly well." But they thought that it was an enemy
that was sunk; for no one of the crew of the Calyndian ship
lived to tell the tale and accuse her. And it is related that Xerxes
exclaimed: "My men have become women, and my women
men."</p>

<p>In this battle perished the admiral, Ariabignes, son of Darius,
and brother of Xerxes, and many other illustrious men of the Persians
and Medes, and the other allies; but only a very few of the
Greeks: for as they knew how to swim, they whose ships were
destroyed, and who did not perish in actual conflict, swam safe to
Salamis; whereas, many of the barbarians, not knowing how to
swim, perished in the sea. When the foremost ships were put to
flight, then the greatest number were destroyed; for those who
were stationed behind, endeavoring to pass on with their ships to
the front, that they, too, might give the king some proof of their
courage, fell foul of their own flying ships. The following event
also occurred in this confusion. Some Phœnicians, whose ships
were destroyed, went to the king and accused the Ionians of
destroying their ships and betraying him. It, however, turned out
that the Ionian captains were not put to death, but that those Phœnicians
who accused them, received the following reward. For
while they were yet speaking, a Samothracian ship bore down on
an Athenian ship and sunk it. Just then an Æginetan ship,
coming up, sunk the ship of the Samothracians. But the Samothracians
being javelin-men, by hurling their javelins, drove the marines
from the ship that had sunk them, and boarded and got possession
of it. This action saved the Ionians: for when Xerxes saw them
perform so great an exploit, he turned round upon the Phœnicians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
and ordered their heads to be struck off, that they who had proved
themselves cowards, might no more accuse those who were braver.</p>

<p>The barbarians turned to flight, and sailing away towards
Phalerus, the Æginetæ waylaid them in the strait, and performed
actions worthy of record. For the Athenians in the rout ran down
both those ships that resisted and those that fled; and the Æginetæ,
those that sailed away from the battle: so that when any
escaped the Athenians they fell into the hands of the Æginetæ.</p>

<p>In this engagement the Æginetæ obtained the greatest
renown; and next, the Athenians. Aristides, of whom I made
mention a little before as a most upright man, in this confusion
that took place about Salamis, took with him a considerable number
of heavy-armed men, who were stationed along the shore of
the Salaminian territory and were Athenians by race, landed
them on the island of Psyttalea, and put to the sword all the Persians
who were on that little island.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>XERXES' RETREAT.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the sea-fight was ended, the Greeks hauled on shore at
Salamis all the wrecks that still happened to be there and held
themselves ready for another battle, expecting the king would still
make use of the ships that survived. But a west wind carrying
away many of the wrecks, drove them on the shore of Attica,
which is called Colias, so as to fulfil both all the other oracles
delivered by Bacis and Musæus concerning this battle, and also
that relating to the wrecks which were drifted on this shore, which
many years before had been delivered by Lysistratus, an Athenian
augur, but had not been understood by any of the Greeks:
"The Colian women shall broil their meat with oars."</p>

<p>When Xerxes saw the defeat he had sustained he was afraid
that some of the Ionians might suggest to the Greeks, or might
themselves resolve to sail to the Hellespont, for the purpose of
breaking up the bridges, and shut him up in Europe. So he planned
immediate flight. But wishing that his intention should not be
known either to the Greeks or his own people, he pretended to
throw a mound across to Salamis. He fastened together Phœnician
merchantmen, that they might serve instead of a raft and a
wall, and made preparation for war, as if about to fight another
battle at sea. Every body who saw him thus occupied, was firmly
convinced that he had seriously determined to stay and continue
the war, except Mardonius, who was well acquainted with his
design. At the same time Xerxes despatched a messenger to the
Persians, to inform them of the misfortune that had befallen him.
There is nothing mortal that reaches its destination more rapidly
than these couriers of the Persians. They say that as many days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
as are occupied in the whole journey, so many horses and men are
posted at regular intervals; neither snow nor rain, nor heat, nor
night, prevents them from performing their appointed stage as
quickly as possible. The first courier delivers his orders to the
second, the second to the third, and so it passes throughout, being
delivered from one to the other, just like the torch-bearing among
the Greeks, which they perform in honor of Vulcan. The first
message that reached Susa, with the news that Xerxes was in possession
of Athens, caused so great joy among the Persians who
had been left behind, that they strewed all the roads with
myrtle, burnt perfumes, and gave themselves up to sacrifices and
festivity. But the arrival of the second messenger threw them into
such consternation, that they all rent their garments, and uttered
unbounded shouts and lamentations, laying the blame on Mardonius,
not so much grieved for the ships
as anxious for Xerxes himself. And this
the Persians continued to do until Xerxes
himself arrived home.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>CELES RIDDEN BY A CUPID.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mardonius, seeing Xerxes much afflicted
by the defeat at Salamis, and
suspecting he was meditating a retreat, thus addressed the
king: "Sire, do not think you have suffered any great loss
in consequence of what has happened; for the contest with us
does not depend on wood alone, but on men and horses. Be not
discouraged; for the Greeks have no means of escape from
rendering an account of what they have done now and formerly,
and from becoming your slaves. If you have resolved not to stay
here, return to Susa, and take with you the greatest part of
the army; but give me three hundred thousand picked men and I
will deliver Greece to you reduced to slavery." Xerxes, delighted
and relieved, granted Mardonius his request. As to Xerxes himself,
if all the men and women of the world had advised him
to stay, in my opinion, he would not have yielded, so great
was his terror. Leaving Mardonius in Thessaly, he marched
in all haste to the Hellespont; and arrived at the place of crossing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
in forty-five days, bringing back no part of his army, so to speak.
Wherever, and among whatever nation, they happened to be
marching, they seized and consumed their corn; but if they found
no fruit, overcome by hunger, they ate up the herbage as it sprung
from the ground, and from sheer hunger stripped off the bark
of trees, and gathered leaves, both of wild and cultivated plants.
But a pestilence and dysentery falling on the army, destroyed them
on their march. Such of them as were sick, Xerxes left behind,
ordering the cities through which he happened to be passing, to
take care of and feed them: some in Thessaly, others at Siris of
Pæonia, and in Macedonia. It was here he had left the sacred
chariot of Jupiter, when he marched against Greece, but he did not
receive it back, as he returned; for the Pæonians had given it
to the Thracians, and when Xerxes demanded it back, said that the
mares had been stolen, as they were feeding, by the upper
Thracians, who dwell round the sources of the Strymon. There
the king of the Bisaltæ and of the Crestonian territory, a Thracian,
perpetrated a most unnatural deed; he declared that he would
not willingly be a slave to Xerxes, but he went up to the top
of Mount Rhodope, and enjoined his sons not to join the expedition
against Greece. They, however, disregarded his prohibition,
from a desire to see the war, and served in the army with
the Persian: but when they all returned safe, six in number, their
father had their eyes put out for this disobedience.</p>

<p>The Persians, in great haste crossed over the Hellespont to
Abydos in their ships; for they found the rafts no longer stretched
across, but broken up by a storm. While detained there, they got
more food than on their march, and having filled themselves immoderately,
and drunk of different water, a great part of the army
that survived, died; the rest with Xerxes reached Sardis. Another
account is also given, that when Xerxes in his retreat from Athens
arrived at Eïon on the Strymon, from there he no longer continued
his journey by land, but committed the army to Hydarnes to conduct
to the Hellespont, and he himself went on board a Phœnician
ship to pass over to Asia. During his voyage a violent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
tempestuous wind from the Strymon overtook him; the storm increased
in violence, and the ship was overloaded, many of the
Persians having accompanied Xerxes. Then the king, becoming
alarmed, calling aloud, and asked the pilot if there was any hope
of safety for them; and he said: "There is none, sire, unless we
get rid of some of this crowd of passengers." Xerxes, hearing
this answer, said: "O Persians, now let some among you show
his regard for the king, for on you my safety seems to depend."
Many having done homage, leapt into the sea, and the ship, being
lighted, thus got safe to Asia. It is added, that Xerxes, immediately
after he landed, presented the pilot with a golden crown, because
he had saved the king's life; but ordered his head to be
struck off, because he had occasioned the loss of many Persians.
This story appears to me not at all deserving of credit, for if such
a speech had been made by the pilot to Xerxes, I should not find
one opinion in ten thousand to deny that the king would have sent
down into the hold of the ship those who were on deck, since they
were Persians, and Persians of high rank, and would have thrown
into the sea a number of Phœnicians, equal to that of the Persians.</p>

<p>When the division of the booty, after the battle of Salamis was
completed, the Greeks sailed to the Isthmus, for the purpose of
conferring the palm of valor upon him among the Greeks who had
proved himself most deserving throughout the war. The generals
distributed the ballots at the altar of Neptune, selecting the first
and second out of all; thereupon every one gave his vote for
himself, each thinking himself the most valiant; but with respect
to the second place, the majority concurred in selecting Themistocles.
So each had but one vote, for first place, but Themistocles
had a great majority for the second honor. Though the Greeks,
out of envy, would not determine this matter, but returned to their
several countries without coming to a decision, yet Themistocles
was applauded and extolled throughout all Greece, as being by far
the wisest man of the Greeks. Because he was not honored by
those who fought at Salamis, although victorious, he immediately
afterward went to Lacedæmon, hoping to be honored there. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
Lacedæmonians received him nobly, and paid him the greatest
honors. They gave the prize of valor to Eurybiades, a crown of
olive; and of wisdom and dexterity to Themistocles, also a crown
of olive. And they presented him with the most magnificent
chariot in Sparta; praising him highly, and on his departure,
three hundred chosen Spartans, called knights, escorted him as far
as the Tegean boundaries. He is the only man that we know of
whom the Spartans ever escorted on his journey.</p>

<p>Mardonius' first movement was to send Alexander, son of
Amyntas, a Macedonian, as an ambassador to Athens; as well
because the Persians were related to him as because he had been
informed that Alexander was a friend and benefactor of the Athenians.
For in this way he thought he should best be able to gain
over the Athenians, having heard that they were a numerous and
valiant people; and besides, he knew that the Athenians had been
the principal cause of the late disaster of the Persians at sea. If
these were won over, he hoped that he should easily become
master at sea, which indeed would have been the case; and on
land he imagined that he was much superior: thus he calculated
that his power would get the upper hand of the Greeks. But the
Athenians gave the following answer to Alexander: "We ourselves
are aware that the power of the Medes is far greater than
ours; so that there is no need to insult us with that. But do not
you attempt to persuade us to come to terms with the barbarian,
for we will not. Go, and tell Mardonius that the Athenians say:
'So long as the sun shall continue in the same course as now, we
will never make terms with Xerxes; but we will go out to oppose
him, trusting in the gods, who fight for us, and in the heroes, whose
temples and images he has burned. Know, therefore, if you did
not know it before, that so long as one Athenian is left alive, the
fight shall be continued.'"</p>

<h2><i>BOOK IX. CALLIOPE.</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE WAR CONTINUED; BATTLE OF PLATÆA AND SIEGE OF THEBES.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Alexander returned and made known to Mardonius the
answer of the Athenians, he set out from Thessaly, and led his
army in haste against Athens; and wherever he arrived from time
to time, he joined the people to his own forces. So far were the
leaders of Thessaly from repenting of what had been before done,
that they urged on the Persian much more: and Thorax of Larissa,
who had assisted in escorting Xerxes in his flight, now openly
gave Mardonius a passage into Greece. When the army on its
march arrived among the Bœotians, the Thebans endeavored to
restrain Mardonius from advancing farther, assuring him that to
take up his station there would be equivalent to subduing the
whole of Greece without a battle. For if the Greeks should continue
firmly united, as they had done before, it would be difficult
even for all mankind to overcome them. "But," they continued,
"if you do what we advise, you will without difficulty frustrate all
their plans. Send money to the most powerful men in the cities;
split Greece into parties, and then, with the assistance of those
who side with you, you may easily subdue those who are not in
your interest." But he was infatuated with a vehement desire to
taking Athens a second time, and fondly hoped, by signal-fires
across the islands, to make known to the king while he was at
Sardis, that he was in possession of Athens. When he arrived in
Attica, he did not find the Athenians there; but was informed
that most of them were at Salamis on board their ships. So he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
took the deserted city ten months after its capture by the king.</p>

<p>But Mardonius was by no means desirous to stay longer in
Attica. He lingered awhile there to see what the Athenians
would do, but neither ravaged nor injured the Attic territory, being
in expectation all along that they would come to terms. But when
he could not persuade them he withdrew, before the Spartans,
under Pausanias, could reach the Isthmus, having first set fire to
Athens, and if any part of the walls, or houses, or temples happened
to be standing, these he threw down and laid all in ruins.
He marched out for the reason that the Attic country was not
adapted for cavalry; and if he should be conquered in an engagement,
there was no way to escape except through a narrow pass,
so that a very small number of men could intercept them. He
determined therefore to retire to Thebes, and to fight near a
friendly city, and in a country adapted for cavalry.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 400px;">

  <div class="caption">
    <p>BŒOTIA.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Lacedæmonians arrived at the Isthmus and went into
camp. When the rest of the Peloponnesians, who favored the
better cause, saw the Spartans marching out, they thought it
would be a disgrace to absent themselves from the expedition of
the Lacedæmonians. Accordingly, when the victims proved favorable,
they all marched out from the Isthmus and advanced to
Eleusis. The Athenians crossed over from Salamis, and joined
them there. At Erythræ in Bœotia, they learnt that the barbarians
were encamped on the Asopus, at which they consulted together,
and formed opposite, at the foot of Mount Cithæron. When the
Greeks did not come down to the plain, Mardonius sent against
them all his cavalry, under command of Masistius, a man highly
esteemed among the Persians. He was mounted on a Nisæan
horse, that had a golden bit, and was otherwise gorgeously caparisoned.
When the cavalry rode up to the Greeks, they charged
them in squadrons, and called them women. By chance the Megarians
happened to be stationed in that part which was most exposed,
and there the cavalry chiefly made their attack. The
Megarians, being hard pressed, sent a herald to the Greek generals
with this message: "The Megarians say, We, O confederates, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
not able alone to sustain the Persian cavalry. So far we have
held out against them by our constancy and courage, though hard
pressed; but now, unless you will send some others to relieve us,
we must abandon our post." Pausanias immediately called for
volunteers to go to that position, and relieve the Megarians.
When all the others refused, three hundred chosen men of the
Athenians undertook to do it, whom Olympiodorus, son of Lampon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
commanded. After a short but spirited battle, as the cavalry
were charging, the horse of Masistius, being in advance of the
others, was wounded in the flank by an arrow, and in pain, reared
and threw Masistius. As he fell, the Athenians immediately
seized his horse and attacked him. At first they were unable to
kill Masistius, he was so thoroughly armed. Underneath he had
a golden cuirass covered with scales, and over the cuirass a purple
cloak. By striking against the cuirass they did nothing; until one
of them, perceiving what was the matter, pierced him in the eye.
So he fell and died. The whole Persian army, and Mardonius
most of all, mourned the loss of Masistius. They cut off their own
hair and that of their horses and beasts of burden, and gave themselves
up to unbounded lamentations. The sound reached over
all Bœotia, of mourning for the loss of a man who, next to Mardonius,
was most esteemed by the Persians and the king.</p>

<p>The Greeks placed the body on a carriage, and carried it along
the line&mdash;an object worthy of admiration, on account of its stature
and beauty&mdash;and the men, leaving their ranks, came out to view
Masistius. After this, they determined to go down toward Platæa,
for the Platæan territory appeared to be much more convenient
for them to encamp in than the Erythræan, as it was better
supplied with water. Over the foot of Mount Cithæron near Hysiæ,
into the Platæan territory they marched, and formed in line,
nation by nation, near the fountain of Gargaphia, and the precinct
of the hero Androcrates, on slight elevations and the level plain.
The whole Grecian army assembled at Platæa, reckoning heavy-armed
and light-armed fighting men, amounted to one hundred
and ten thousand.</p>

<p>When the barbarians, with Mardonius, had ceased to mourn for
Masistius, they also marched to the Asopus, which flows by
Platæa, and on their arrival were drawn up by Mardonius. Of
barbarians there were three hundred thousand, as has been already
shown; but of Greeks who were allies of Mardonius no one
knows the number, for they were not reckoned up; but, to make
a guess, I conjecture that they were assembled to the number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
fifty thousand. These were infantry; the cavalry were marshalled
apart.</p>

<p>On the second day, both sides offered sacrifices. For the
Greeks, Tisamenus, son of Antiochus, was the person who sacrificed,
for he accompanied this army as diviner. The sacrifices
were favorable to the Greeks, if they stood on the defensive; but
if they crossed the Asopus, and began the battle, not so.</p>

<div class="image-float-right" style="max-width: 150px;">

  <div class="caption">
    <p>COAT OF MAIL.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>To Mardonius, who was very desirous to begin the battle, the
sacrifices were not propitious; but to him also, if he stood on the
defensive, they were favorable: for he
too adopted the Greek sacrifices, having
for his diviner Hegesistratus, an Elean,
and the most renowned of the Telliadæ.
This man, before these events, the Spartans
had taken and bound for death, because
they had suffered many atrocious
things from him. In this sad condition, as
being in peril for his life, and having to
suffer many tortures before death, he performed
a deed beyond belief. For as he
was confined in stocks bound with iron,
he got possession of a knife, which had
by some means been carried in, and
immediately cut off the broad part of
his foot&mdash;the most resolute deed I ever heard of. Then, as
he was guarded by sentinels, he dug a hole through the wall
and escaped to Tegea, travelling by night, and by day hiding himself
in the woods and tarrying there. Thus, though the Lacedæmonians
searched for him with their whole population, on the third
night he arrived at Tegea; but they were struck with great amazement
at his daring, when they saw half his foot lying on the
ground, and were not able to find him. In time, cured of his
wounds, he procured a wooden foot, and became an avowed
enemy to the Lacedæmonians. However, at last his hatred conceived
against the Lacedæmonians did not benefit him; for he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
taken by them when acting as diviner at Zacynthus, and put to
death. The death of Hegesistratus took place after the battle of
Platæa: but at that time, on the Asopus, he was hired by Mardonius
for no small sum to sacrifice, and was very zealous, both
from hatred to the Lacedæmonians and from a love of gain.</p>

<p>Meantime, Timagenides, a Theban, advised Mardonius to guard
the passes of Mount Cithæron; saying, that the Greeks were continually
pouring in every day, and that he would intercept great
numbers. Eight days had already elapsed since they had been
posted opposite each other; but Mardonius thought the suggestion
good, and as soon as it was night, sent some cavalry to the
passes of Cithæron, that lead to Platæa, which the Bœotians call
The Three Heads; but the Athenians, The Heads of Oak. The
horsemen that were sent did not arrive in vain; for issuing on the
plain, they took five hundred beasts carrying provisions from
Peloponnesus to the army, with the men who attended the beasts
of burden. The Persians not only took the booty, but killed without
mercy, sparing neither beast nor man. Two more days passed,
neither being willing to begin the battle; but when the eleventh
day after the two armies had been encamped opposite each other
in Platæa was almost gone, and the night was far advanced, and
silence appeared to prevail throughout the camps, Alexander, son
of Amyntas, who was general and king of the Macedonians, rode
up on horseback to the sentries of the Athenians, and desired to
confer with their generals. Most of the sentries remained at their
posts, while some ran to the generals, and told them, "that a man
had come on horseback from the camp of the Medes, who uttered
not a word more, but, naming the generals, said he wished to confer
with them." They immediately repaired to the out-posts, and
Alexander addressed them as follows: "O Athenians, I leave
these words with you as a deposit, entreating you to keep them
secret, and not tell them to any other than Pausanias, lest you
should ruin me. I should not utter them, were I not extremely
concerned for the safety of all Greece; for I am myself a Greek by
origin, and would by no means wish to see Greece enslaved instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
of free. I tell you, then, that the victims have not been favorable
to Mardonius and his army, or else you would have fought long
ago; but now, he has determined to dismiss the victims, and to
come to an engagement at dawn of day; fearing, as I conjecture,
that you may assemble in greater numbers. Therefore be ready.
But if Mardonius should defer the engagement, and not undertake
it, persevere remaining where you are, for in a few days provisions
will fail him. And if this war should terminate according to your
wishes, it is right that you should bear it in mind to effect my
freedom, who on behalf of the Greeks have undertaken so hazardous
a task, as to acquaint you with the intention of Mardonius, in
order that the barbarians may not fall upon
you unexpectedly. I am Alexander the
Macedonian." Thus having spoken, he rode
back to the camp and his own station.</p>

    <p>THE FISHERMAN.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The generals of the Athenians went to
the right wing, and told Pausanias what
they had heard from Alexander; but as the
army was deprived of water and harassed
by the cavalry of Mardonius, they remained
to deliberate on these and other matters.
They had no longer any provisions, and
their attendants, who had been despatched to the Peloponnesus
to get provisions, were shut out by the cavalry, and unable to
reach the camp.</p>

<p>On consultation the generals of the allies resolved, if the Persians
should defer making the attack on that day, to remove to the
island of Oëroë, ten stades distant from the Asopus, on which
they were then encamped. This is an island in the midst of the
continent. For the river, dividing higher up, flows down to the
plain from Mount Cithæron, having its streams about three stades
separate from each other, and united together below. To this
place they determined to remove, that they might have an abundant
supply of water, and the cavalry might not harass them, as
when they were directly opposite. So, in the night, at the hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
agreed upon, they fled from the cavalry toward the city of the
Platæans until they arrived at the temple of Juno, which stands
before the city of the Platæans, twenty stades distant from the
fountain of Gargaphia. They then encamped round the Heræum
and stood to their arms before the sacred precinct.</p>

<p>When Mardonius was informed that the Greeks had withdrawn
under cover of night, and saw the place deserted, he summoned
Thorax, of Larissa, and said: "O son of Aleuas, what will you say
now, when you see this ground deserted? For you, their neighbor,
said that the Lacedæmonians never fled from battle, but were
the first of men in matters of war; but now we all see that they
have fled away during the past night, in terror of us, who are truly
the most valiant in the world." Then without more ado he led
the Persians at full speed, crossing the Asopus in the track of the
Greeks, as if they had betaken themselves to flight. He directed
his course only against the Lacedæmonians and Tegeans; for on
account of the hills he did not espy the Athenians, who had turned
into the plain. The rest of the commanders of the barbarians'
brigades, seeing the Persians advancing to pursue the Greeks, all
immediately took up their standards, and pursued, each as quick
as he could, without observing either rank or order; thus they
advanced with a shout and in a throng, as if they were about to
overwhelm the Greeks.</p>

<p>The Persians made a fence with their osier-shields, and let fly
their arrows so incessantly that the Spartans being hard pressed,
and the victims continuing unfavorable, Pausanias looked toward
the temple of Juno of the Platæans, and invoked the goddess,
praying that they might not be disappointed of their hopes.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 250px;">
  <img src="images/p315.jpg" width="250" height="442" alt=""/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p>JUNO.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>While he was yet making this invocation, the Tegeans, starting
first, advanced against the barbarians; and immediately after the
prayer of Pausanias, the victims became favorable to the Lacedæmonians.
Then they advanced against the Persians, who withstood
them, laying aside their bows. First of all a battle took
place about the fence of bucklers; and when that was thrown
down, a long, obstinate fight ensued near the temple of Ceres, till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
at last they came to close conflict, when the barbarians laid hold of
the Spartan spears and broke them. Indeed, in courage and
strength, the Persians were not inferior, but were lightly armed,
ignorant of military discipline, and not equal to their adversaries
in skill. They rushed forward upon the Spartans, only to perish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
In that part where Mardonius happened to be, fighting upon a white
horse, at the head of a thousand chosen men, the best of the Persians,
there they pressed their adversaries most vigorously. For as
long as Mardonius survived, they held out, defended themselves,
and overthrew many of the Lacedæmonians; but when Mardonius
had died, and the troops stationed round him, which were the
strongest, had fallen, then the rest turned to flight, and gave way
to the Lacedæmonians. Their dress, too, was particularly disadvantageous
to them, being destitute of defensive armor. Here
satisfaction for the death of Leonidas, according to the oracle, was
paid to the Spartans by Mardonius; and Pausanias obtained the
most signal victory we have ever heard of. Mardonius died by
the hand of Aïmnestus, a man of distinction at Sparta, who, some
time after the Medic affairs, at the head of three hundred men,
engaged at Stenyclerus with all the Messenians, and he himself
perished and his three hundred. When the Persians at Platæa
were put to flight by the Lacedæmonians, they fled in disorder to
their own camp, and to the wooden fortification which they had
made in the Theban territory. It is a wonder to me that, when
they fought near the grove of Ceres, not one of the barbarians was
seen to enter into the sacred enclosure, or to die in it, but most
fell round the precinct in unconsecrated ground. I am of opinion,
if it is allowable to form an opinion concerning divine things, that
the goddess would not receive them because they had burnt her
royal temple at Eleusis.</p>

<p>When the Persians and the rest of the throng arrived in their
flight at the wooden wall, they mounted the towers before the
Lacedæmonians came up, and defended the wall in the best way they
could; so that when the Lacedæmonians arrived, a vigorous battle
took place before the walls. So long as the Athenians were absent,
the barbarians defended themselves, and had much the advantage
over the Lacedæmonians, as they were not skilled in
attacking fortifications; but when the Athenians came, then a
vehement fight at the walls took place, and continued for a long
time. But at length the Athenians, by their valor and pluck, surmounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
the wall, and made a breach; there at length the Greeks
poured in. The Tegeans entered first, and plundered the tent of
Mardonius, and among other things took away the manger for his
horse, all of bronze, and well worth seeing. This manger of Mardonius
the Tegeans placed in the temple of the Alean Minerva;
but all the other things they took they carried to the same place
as the rest of the Greeks. The barbarians no longer kept in close
order, nor did any one think of valor; but they were in a state of
consternation, as so many myriads of men were enclosed within so
small a space; and the Greeks had such an easy opportunity of
slaughtering them, that of an army of three hundred thousand
men, except forty thousand with whom Artabazus fled, not three
thousand survived. Of Lacedæmonians from Sparta, all that died
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
in the engagement were ninety-one; of Tegeans, sixteen; and
of Athenians, fifty-two.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>ELEGANT VASES AND AMPHORÆ.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Pausanias made proclamation that no one should touch the
booty, and commanded the helots to bring together all the treasures.
Dispersing themselves through the camp, they found tents
decked with gold and silver, and couches gilt and plated, and
golden bowls, and cups, and other drinking vessels; they also
found sacks on the waggons, in which were discovered gold and silver
cauldrons: and from the bodies that lay dead they stripped
bracelets, necklaces, and scimetars of gold; but no account at all
was taken of the variegated apparel. Of this the helots stole a
great deal and sold it to the Æginetæ, so that the great wealth of the
Æginetæ here had its beginning, for they purchased gold from the
helots as if it had been bronze. They collected the treasures together,
and took from them a tithe for the god at Delphi, from
which the golden tripod was dedicated, which stands on the three-headed
bronze serpent, close to the altar; they also took a
tithe for the god at Olympia, from which they dedicated
the bronze Jupiter, ten cubits high; and a tithe to the god
at the Isthmus, from which was made the bronze Neptune,
seven cubits high. They divided the rest, and each
took the share he was entitled to, of the gold, silver, and
other treasures, and beasts of burden. Now what choice treasures
were given those others who most distinguished themselves at
Platæa, is mentioned by no one. But for Pausanias, ten of
every thing was selected and given him&mdash;slaves, horses, talents,
camels, and all other treasures in like manner. It is said also that
when Xerxes fled from Greece, he left all his own equipage to
Mardonius; Pausanias, therefore, seeing Mardonius' equipage
furnished with gold, silver, and various-colored hangings, ordered
the bakers and cooks to prepare a supper in the same manner as
for Mardonius: and, astonished at the profusion set before him of
gold and silver couches handsomely carved, and gold and silver
tables, and magnificent preparations for the supper, he in derision
ordered his own attendants to prepare a Laconian supper by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
side of it, and when the repast was spread, the difference was so
ridiculous that he laughed, and sent for the generals of the Greeks
and said: "Men of Greece, I have called you together to show
you the folly of the leader of the Medes, who left such sumptuous
fare as this, to come to us, who have such poor fare, to take it
from us." A considerable time after these events, many of the
Platæans found chests of gold and silver, and other precious
things. And still later was discovered a skull without any seam,
consisting of one bone, and an upper jaw which had teeth growing
in a piece, all in one bone, both the front teeth and the grinders;
and there was likewise discovered the skeleton of a man five cubits
high.</p>

<p>When the Greeks had buried their dead in Platæa, they immediately
determined, on consultation, to march against Thebes,
and to demand the surrender of those who had sided with the
Medes, amongst the first of them Timegenides and Attaginus,
who were the chief leaders; and, if they should not give them up,
they resolved not to depart from the city before they had taken it.
On the eleventh day after the engagement, they arrived and besieged
the Thebans, requiring them to give up the men; and, receiving
"No" for an answer, they ravaged the country, and
attacked the walls. As they did not cease damaging them, on the
twentieth day Timegenides spoke thus to the Thebans: "Men of
Thebes, since the Greeks have so resolved that they will not give
over besieging us until either they have taken Thebes, or you
have delivered us up to them, let not the Bœotian territory suffer
any more on our account. But if, being desirous of money, they
demand us as a pretence, let us give them money from the public
treasury; for we sided with the Mede by general consent, and not
of ourselves alone. If, however, they carry on the siege really because
they want us, we will present ourselves before them to plead
our cause." He appeared to speak well and to the purpose; and
the Thebans immediately sent a herald to Pausanias, expressing
their willingness to surrender the men. When they had agreed
on these terms, Attaginus escaped from the city, and his sons, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
were brought before him, Pausanias acquitted from the charge,
saying that boys could have no part in the guilt of siding with the
Mede. As to the others whom the Thebans delivered up, they
thought that they should be admitted to plead their cause, and
moreover trusted to repel the charge by bribery; but he, as soon
as he had them in his power, suspecting this very thing, dismissed
the whole army of the allies, and, conducting the men to Corinth,
put them to death.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>THE BATTLE OF MYCALE.</small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the same day on which the defeat at Platæa occurred,
another happened to take place at Mycale in Ionia. For while
the Greeks were stationed at Delos, there came to them as ambassadors
from Samos, Lampon, Athenagoras, and Hegesistratus,
being sent by the Samians, unknown to the Persians. When they
came to the generals, Hegesistratus urged that "if only the Ionians
should see them, they would revolt from the Persians, and that the
barbarians would not withstand them; or, if they should withstand
them, the Greeks would not find any other such booty." Invoking,
too, their common gods, he besought them to deliver Grecian
men from servitude, and to repel the barbarian; and he said,
"that this would be easy for them to do, for their ships sailed
badly, and were not fit to fight with them; and, if they suspected
at all that they were leading them on deceitfully, they were themselves
ready to go on board their ships as hostages." The Samian
stranger was so earnest in his entreaties, that Leotychides asked:
"O Samian friend, what is your name?" "Hegesistratus," he
answered; upon which, interrupting the rest of his discourse,
Leotychides exclaimed: "I accept the "Hegesistratus,"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
my Samian friend; only do you take care that before you sail away
both you yourself and those who are with you, pledge your faith
that the Samians will be zealous allies to us." The Samians immediately
pledged their faith and made oath of confederacy with
the Greeks. The others sailed home, but he ordered Hegesistratus
to sail with the fleet, regarding his name as an omen. The
Greeks tarried that day, and on the next sacrificed auspiciously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
Deiphonus, son of Evenius, of Apollonia in the Ionian gulf, acting
as diviner.</p>

<p>The following incident befel his father, Evenius. There are in
this Apollonia sheep sacred to the sun, which by day feed near the
river that flows from Mount Lacmon through the Apollonian territory
into the sea, near the port of Oricus; but by night, chosen
men, the most eminent of the citizens for wealth and birth, keep
watch over them, each for a year: for the Apollonians set a high
value upon these sheep, in consequence of some oracle. They are
folded in a cavern at a distance from the city. There, once on a
time, Evenius, being chosen, kept watch, and one night when he
had fallen asleep during his watch, wolves entered the cave, and
destroyed about sixty of the sheep. When he discovered what
had happened, he mentioned it to no one, purposing to buy others,
and put them in their place. This occurrence, however, did not
escape the notice of the Apollonians; and as soon as they discovered
it, they brought him to trial, and gave sentence that, for
having fallen asleep during his watch, he should be deprived of
sight. But after they had blinded Evenius, from that time forward
neither did their sheep multiply, nor did the land yield its
usual fruit. An admonition was given them at Dodona and Delphi,
when they inquired of the prophets the cause of the present calamities
"that they had unjustly deprived Evenius, the keeper of the
sacred sheep, of his sight; for they themselves had sent the wolves,
and would not cease avenging him, until the people should give
such satisfaction for what they had done, as he himself should
choose, and think sufficient: then, the gods themselves would give
such a present to Evenius, that most men would pronounce him
happy, from possessing it." The Apollonians, keeping this answer
secret, deputed some of their citizens to negociate the matter with
Evenius. One day when he was seated on a bench, they went
and sat down by him, and conversed on different subjects, till at
length they began to commiserate his misfortune, and leading him
artfully on, they asked, "what reparation he would choose, if the
Apollonians were willing to give him satisfaction for what they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
done." Not having heard of the oracle he made this choice, "if
any one would give him the lands of certain citizens," naming those
who he knew had the two best estates in Apollonia, "and besides
these a house," which he knew was the handsomest in the city,
he said, "he would thenceforth forego his anger, and this reparation
would content him." Immediately taking him up they said,
"the Apollonians make you this reparation for the loss of your
eyes, in obedience to an oracle they have received." He thereupon
was very indignant, on hearing the whole truth, for he had
been deceived; but the Apollonians bought the property from the
owners, and gave him what he had chosen, and immediately the
gift of divination was implanted in him, so that he became very
celebrated.</p>

<p>Deiphonus, the son of this Evenius, was brought by the Corinthians
to officiate as diviner to the army.</p>

<p>The Greeks at length determined to sail to the continent: having
therefore prepared boarding-ladders, and all other things that
were necessary for a sea-fight, they sailed to Mycale. No one
was seen near the camp, ready to meet them, but they beheld the
ships drawn up within the fortification, and a numerous land-force
disposed along the beach, thereupon Leotychides, advancing
first in a ship, and nearing the beach as closely as possible,
made proclamation by a herald to the Ionians, saying: "Men
of Ionia, as many of you as hear me, attend to what I say; for the
Persians will understand nothing of the advice I give you. When
we engage, it behooves every one first of all to remember
Liberty; and next the watch-word, Hebe; and let him who does
not hear this, learn it from those who do hear." The meaning
of this proceeding was the same as that of Themistocles at
Artemisium; for either these words, being concealed from the
barbarians, would induce the Ionians to revolt, or, if they should be
reported to the barbarians, would make them distrustful of the
Greeks. Then the Greeks put their ships to shore, landed on the
beach, and drew up in order of battle. But when the Persians
saw them preparing for action, and knew that they had admonished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
the Ionians, they suspected that the Samians favored the Greeks,
and took away their arms.</p>

<p>Then the Greeks advanced toward the barbarians; and a
rumor flew through the whole army that a herald's staff was seen
lying on the beach and that the Greeks had fought and conquered
the army of Mardonius in Bœotia. Thus the interposition of
heaven is manifest by many plain signs; since on this same day on
which the defeat at Platæa took place, and when that at Mycale
was just about to happen, a rumor reached the Greeks in this
latter place; so that the army was inspired with much greater
courage, and was more eager to meet danger.</p>

<p>The Athenians, and those who were drawn up next to them,
forming about half the army, had to advance along the shore over
level ground; but the Lacedæmonians and their associates, along
a ravine and some hills. So that whilst the Lacedæmonians were
making a circuit, those in the other wing were already engaged.
Now, so long as the bucklers of the Persians remained standing,
they defended themselves strenuously, and had not the worst
of the battle; but when the Athenians and their comrades mutually
encouraged one another, in order that the victory might belong to
them, and not to the Lacedæmonians, they flew with such vigor
into the battle, that the face of affairs was immediately changed.
They broke through the bucklers and fell in a body upon
the Persians. They sustained the attack and defended themselves
for a time but at last fled to the fortification. The Athenians,
Corinthians, Sicyonians, and Trœzenians, drawn up in order
together, following close upon them, rushed into the fortification at
the same time. When the fortification was taken, the barbarians
no longer thought of resisting, but all except the Persians betook
themselves to flight; they, in small detachments, fought with the
Greeks who were continually rushing within the fortification. And of
the Persian generals, two made their escape, and two died. Artayntes
and Ithramitres, commanders of the naval forces escaped;
but Mardontes, and Tigranes, generals of the land army, died
fighting. While the Persians were still fighting, the Lacedæmonians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
came up, and assisted in accomplishing the rest. Of
the Greeks themselves many fell on this occasion, especially the
Sicyonians, and their general Perilaus. The Samians, who were in
the camp of the Medes and had been deprived of their arms,
as soon as they saw the battle turning, did all they could, wishing
to help the Greeks; and the rest of the Ionians, as the Samians led
the way, fled from the Persians and attacked the barbarians.
The Milesians had been appointed to guard the passes for the
Persians so that in the event of failure they might have guides to
conduct them to the heights of Mycale. They, however, did
every thing contrary to what was ordered; guiding them in their
flight by other ways which led to the enemy, and at last themselves
assisted in slaying them. Thus Ionia revolted a second time from
the Persians. In this battle of the Greeks, the Athenians most distinguished
themselves. When they had killed most of the
barbarians, some fighting and others flying, they brought out
all the booty on the beach, including several chests of money, and
burnt the ships and the whole fortification. Then they took into
their alliance the Samians, Chians, Lesbians, and other islanders,
who were then serving with the Greeks, bound them by pledges
and oaths that they would remain firm and not revolt; then
sailed to the Hellespont, and home.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
